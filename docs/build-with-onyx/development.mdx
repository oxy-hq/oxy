<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize a new repository">

```bash
onyx init  # Initialize a folder as an onyx project
```

This will construct a scaffolding within the current working directory with the necessary directories and a `default` agent for you to start working with.

This will also initialize a global config file in `~/.config/onyx/config.yml` (if it doesn't already exist). You should populate this with information with your warehouse credentials and LLM preferences.

</Step>
<Step title="Seed SQL queries">

Put some SQL queries into the `data` directory to seed the engine.

**Oxygen** **("oxy")** is an open-source, full-stack Data + AI platform for agentic data analytics. We combine a data modeling engine (ontology engine), an agent and automation engine, an agentic application engine, a data lakehouse, and an ETL engine, to become a one-stop shop for anything Data and AI.

**Oxygen** is grounded in deterministic execution principles. Written in Rust and declarative by design, Oxygen provides the foundational components needed to transform AI-driven data analysis into reliable, production-ready systems through structured primitives, semantic understanding, and predictable execution.

**Oxygen** applies software development lifecycle principles (e.g. build-test-deploy pipeline) to AI-driven data analytics.

**Oxygen** establishes a structured workflow for data agents, involving agent creation, prompt testing, and production deployment.

Specifically, this process is implemented as follows:

- **Agent Configuration**: Define agents using `.agent.yml` files that specify their instructions. Provide context through `.sql` and `.schema.yml` files that supply queries and semantic information, respectively.
- **Workflow Development**: Create `.workflow.yml` files to orchestrate multi-step processes. Chain validated agents and tasks together into reusable, production-ready automations.
- **Testing Framework**: Add test cases directly to `.agent.yml` or `.workflow.yml` files. Execute tests using the `oxy test` command.

You can run individual agents with `oxy run path/to/agent_name.agent.yml "question"` or execute complete workflows using `oxy run path/to/workflow_name.workflow.yml`.

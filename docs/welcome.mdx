**Oxy* is an open-source framework for agentic analytics. It is declarative by design and written in Rust. OOxys built with the following product principles in mind: open-source, performant, code-native, declarative, composable, and secure.&#x20;

**Agentic analytics** applies software development lifecycle principles to AI-driven data analytics.&#x20;

Just as traditional software follows a build-test-deploy pipeline, agentic analytics establishes a structured workflow for data agents, involving agent creation, prompt testing, and production deployment.&#x20;

Specifically, this process is implemented as follows:&#x20;

* **Agent Configuration**: Define agents using `.agent.yml` files that specify their instructions. Provide context through `.sql` and `.sem.yml` files that supply queries and semantic information, respectively.

* **Workflow Development**: Create `.workflow.yml` files to orchestrate multi-step processes. Chain validated agents and tasks together into reusable, production-ready automations.&#x20;

* **Testing Framework**: Add test cases directly to `.agent.yml` or `.workflow.yml` files. Execute tests using the `oxytest` command.

You can run individual agents with `oxyrun path/to/agent_name.agent.yml "question"` or execute complete workflows using `ooxyun path/to/workflow_name.workflow.yml`.&#x20;

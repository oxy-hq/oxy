Oxy is an open-source framework for building agentic analytics systems grounded in deterministic execution principles. Written in Rust and declarative by design, Oxy provides the foundational components needed to transform ad hoc AI-driven data analysis into reliable, production-ready systems through structured primitives, semantic understanding, and predictable execution.

### **A Complete System for Agentic Analytics**

Oxy brings together three core components that work in harmony:

**Deterministic Workflows**: Orchestration through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that combine deterministic operations (like SQL execution) with agentic tasks into predictable execution paths.

**Comprehensive Validation**: Every function call is validated against schema definitions to ensure field references, operators, and value types are compatible - creating predictable outcomes even from natural language inputs.

**Flexible Semantic Layer**: Traditional semantic layers were designed mainly for dashboarding and BI tools. Oxy’s semantic layer generalizes this idea for agentic systems, providing just enough structure to enable meaningful reasoning over data without forcing a rigid abstraction. You can define views, dimensions, and measures for rich modeling, or use lightweight SQL templates when flexibility is preferred.

This unified approach combines the adaptability of AI agents with the reliability of deterministic systems, enabling teams to serve analyses that are not only insightful, but trustworthy.

### **Built on Core Principles**

We built Oxy for ourselves, shaped by years of working in the data space and internalizing the lessons that came along. We don’t believe in vendor lock-in, opaque system design, or tools that force consolidation under the guise of simplicity. As a result, Oxy is **open-source, declarative, and composable by design** — a framework for assembling agentic analytics systems that stay predictable, modular, and scalable, while integrating naturally with the tools you already use.

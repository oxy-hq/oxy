**Onyx** is a lightweight, declarative framework for agentic analytics.
**Agentic analytics** applies software development lifecycle principles to
AI-driven data analysis. Just as traditional software follows a
build-test-deploy pipeline, agentic analytics establishes a structured workflow
for AI agents, involving agent creation, prompt testing, and production
deployment.

Specifically, this process is implemented as follows:

- **Agent Configuration**: Define agents using `.agent.yml` files that specify their instructions. Provide context through `.sql` and `.sem.yml` files that supply queries and semantic information, respectively.
- **Workflow Development**: Create `.workflow.yml` files to orchestrate multi-step processes. Chain validated agents and tasks together into reusable, production-ready automations.
- **Testing Framework**: Add test cases directly to `.agent.yml` or `.workflow.yml` files. Execute tests using the `onyx test` command.

You can run individual agents with `onyx run path/to/agent_name.agent.yml "question"` or execute complete workflows using `onyx run path/to/workflow_name.workflow.yml`.

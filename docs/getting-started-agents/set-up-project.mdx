title: Set up your project
description: Getting started with oxy, with real data
---

To get a quick sense of how oxy works, your best bet is to set up our demo
instance using `oxy init`, as laid out [here](/quickstart). If you want to use your
own data and get started building your own agents and workflows, you can follow
the guide below. If you don't have some data available, you can also run `oxy
init`, use the defaults, then follow along in the guide with the demo data
provided therein.

In the following guide, we'll build up a simple agent and workflow that
operates against some local csv data.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Set up your project folder">

    To get started, create a new project folder where you'll hold your oxy
    files.

    We personally like keeping our oxy projects within a folder in your home
    directory `~/projects`. If you wish, you can follow this pattern by running
    the following command from the command-line, which will create this
    directory and move you to it.

    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/projects/new-oxy-project && cd ~/projects/new-oxy-project/
    ```

    <Note>
    If you want a quick crash course on command-line commands, you can find a cheat sheet [here](/reference/cli-commands).
    </Note>

    <Note>
      Oxy is directory-based, meaning we'll look for files in the current
      working directory when running commands. We'll look recursively upward
      until we find a `config.yml` file, which should sit at the root of your oxy
      folder. 
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your data with a config.yml file">

    Now that you have a basic repository set up, the first step is to connect
    your data. We support a [variety of connectors](/integrations/overview), but
    we recommend using [duckdb](/integrations/data-sources/duckdb) with some
    local flat files (e.g. csv or parquet files) to get started. Oxy comes
    bundled with duckdb by default, meaning you can simply drop some csv files
    into your oxy repository and you're good to go.

    To get started, you'll have to create a `config.yml` file in the root of
    your oxy repository. You can do this by running the following command from
    within the oxy project folder:

    ```sh
    touch config.yml
    ```

    Using your favorite text editor, open this file and add the following:

    ```yaml
    databases:
      - name: local
        type: duckdb
        dataset: ./
    ```

    This sets up a **duckdb query engine called `local`**. This duckdb instance
    executes from your local oxy directory (the path is specified by the
    `dataset` key and is defined relative to the oxy directory).

    This can have any name you'd like, but remember the name -- you'll be
    using the name to specify which database to use within your agent and
    workflow files.

    [Integrations](/integrations/overview) section.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your model in config.yml">

    Adding a model to your oxy repository is also a matter of modifying the
    `config.yml` file. Open this file up again, and add the following section:

    ```yaml
    models:
      - name: openai-4.1
        vendor: openai
        model_ref: gpt-4.1
        key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```

    For this, you'll need to obtain an OpenAI API key, which you can do
    [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). You'll need to save your API
    key as an environment variable with name specified in `key_var` -- in this
    case: `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

    In order to save your API key as an environment variable, you can add the
    following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

    ```sh
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

    Remember to restart your terminal instance once this is done, or the rc file won't
    be sourced (and so your environment variables won't be updated).

    <Note>

    To connect a different model, you can check out our
    [Integrations](/integrations/overview) section.

Now that you're done setting up your project scaffolding, you can [set up your first agent](creating-your-first-agent).

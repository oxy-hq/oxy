title: Creating your first agent
---

<Note>
To learn more about agents, check out our dedicated [agents section](/learn-about-oxy/agents).
</Note>

In this guide, we'll walk through building your first agent. Agents are defined
in `.agent.yml` files, and anything with that extension within your oxy
repository will be recognized as an agent.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Creating an .agent.yml file">

    Create a new file in your oxy repository called `my-agent.agent.yml`. You
    can do so by running the following command from within your oxy repository:

    ```sh
    touch my-agent.agent.yml
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Specifying the model to use">

    Now you need to specify which model you want this agent to use. If you've
    been following our guide thus far, you should have a model named
    `openai-4.1`, named during our [setup](set-up-project).

    Open your `my-agent.agent.yml` file in a text editor, and add the following line:

    ```yaml
    model: openai-4.1
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Adding system instructions">

    Now we need to give the LLM some instructions. Typically, large language
    models accept two components to a prompt: (1) the prompt itself and (2) a
    series of system instructions indicating how the LLM should behave.

    We'll be using the latter (the `system_instructions`) to give our LLM
    general instructions as well as context on our data.

    ```yaml
    system_instructions: |
      You are a data analyst. Write and execute SQL to answer the given question.
    ```

    <Note>

    The `oxy run` command takes agent files or workflow files as arguments.
    Therefore, if you're not in the same directory as your agent file, you need
    to specify the relative path to the agent, with e.g. `oxy run
    path/to/my-agent.agent.yml`.

    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Giving your agent the ability to execute SQL">

    To make this agent suitable for analytics purposes, you'll need to give it
    the ability to execute the SQL it writes. To do this, you can add a `tools`
    section to your `.agent.yml` file, as follows:

    ```yaml
    tools:
      - name: execute_sql
        type: execute_sql
        database: local
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Creating a file with schema information">

    The final step in getting your agent running is to give it some context to
    get started. To do this, we'll need to create a file with some schema
    information. Let's create a new `schema.txt`` file in the root of your
    oxy directory.

    ```sh
    touch schema.txt
    ```

    In this file, we'll include some details about your data. We've found that
    supplying a list of csv files, each with a list of columns and a sample row
    works reasonably well. You can simply copy the first two lines of your csv,
    then preface the header row with `columns:` and the row of data with
    `sample row:`, as follows. You should also add in a sample query so the LLM
    gets a sense of how to query this.

    ```yaml
    # Schema information
    - `sleeps.csv`
      columns: Cycle start time,Cycle end time,Cycle timezone
      sample row: 2025-02-03 22:33:01,2025-02-04 08:33:01,UTC-08:00

    # Sample queries
    select "Cycle start time" from 'sleeps.csv'
    ```

    This whole thing will be slurped up into your system instructions, so feel
    free to add any additional context about your data here as well.

    <Note>

    To test any queries you write, you can run `oxy run <filename>.sql`.

    </Note>

    <Warning>

    If your agent is having trouble parsing the schema information, it may make
    sense to instead inject it as json, or specify the sample values within a
    [semantic model](/learn-about-oxy/semantic-model).

    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Giving this context to your agent">

    Now you can add this file to a `context` section within your `.agent.yml`
    file, as follows:

    ```yaml
    context:
      - name: schema_information
        type: file
        src:
          - schema.txt
    ```

    Then, reference this object with Jinja in your system instructions:

    ```yaml
    system_instructions: | 
      You are a data analyst. Write and execute SQL to answer the given question.

      {{ context.schema_information }}
    ```

    <Warning>

    Note that `file`-type `context` objects take an array (whereas
    `semantic_model` type `src` entries will take a single value, because they
    are parsed).

    </Warning>

  </Step>

</Steps>

At this point, your agent will at least be able to answer some basic questions
about your data. You can test it by running the following from the
command-line (replace the string in quotes with a proper question):

```sh
oxy run my-agent.agent.yml "Ask a question here"
```

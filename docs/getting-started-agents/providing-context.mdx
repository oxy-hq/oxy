Now that you have something rudimentary working, you'll want to augment your
agent with richer context. We suggest doing this in one of two ways:

1. Adding queries.
2. Adding semantic models.

# Adding queries as context

The cleanest way to add queries as context is to create a dedicated directory
for your queries, then use a wild-card (`*.sql`) to slurp them all up into a
`context` object, as follows:

```yaml
context:
  - name: queries
    type: file
    src:
      - "*.sql"
```

We suggest adding a comment at the top of each query explaining what the query
is for, so the LLM has this context. The resulting queries can then be injected
into your `system_instructions` using Jinja, as follows:

```yaml
system_instructions: |
  You are a data analyst. Write and execute SQL to answer the given question.

  {{ context.schema_information }}

  # Queries
  {{ context.queries }}
```

# Adding semantic models as context

Sometimes you don't need a full set of queries, but simply some snippets of SQL
that represent metric calculations, dimension calculations, etc. -- something
minimal to bridge business logic to query logic.

In these situations, building a semantic model is a good choice. Each semantic
model has three required fields: `measures`, `dimensions`, and `entities`.
`measures` are special, in that they require a `sql` field to run. The other
objects only require a `name` field, though a few other fields (of note:
`sample` (an array of sample data), `description` (a plaintext description of
the column), `synonyms` (an array of synonyms for the column)). We suggest
using the column name as `name`.

A sample semantic model is shown below:

```yaml
entities:
  - name: content_id
    description: content_id
    sample: [1, 2, 3, 4]

dimensions:
  - name: month
    sample:
      - "2024-08"
  - name: property_grouping
    synonyms:
      - "property_grouping"
    sample:
      - "Fruit"
      - "Vegetable"

measures:
  - name: count_content_id
    sql: sum(distinct content_id)
```

You can learn more about semantic models in our dedicated [semantic models
section](learn-about-oxy/semantic-model).

At this point, your agent should be generally good to go, and you have the
basic tools required to improve the agent when you encounter issues. To start
familiarizing yourself with how to iterate on your agent more robustly, check

agent](how-to-test-your-agent).

## Overview

The semantic layer in Oxy is a powerful abstraction that transforms raw database schemas into business-friendly concepts. It provides a declarative way to define business logic, metrics, and relationships that AI agents can understand and use to answer analytical questions accurately.

Think of it as a translation layer between your technical data infrastructure and business questions. Instead of requiring users or AI agents to understand complex database schemas and SQL, they can work with intuitive business concepts like "total revenue," "customer segments," or "monthly active users."

<Note>
  Oxy also supports a simpler semantic model format (`.schema.yml`) for straightforward use cases. See [Semantic Model](/learn-about-oxy/semantic-model) for a lighter-weight alternative.

## Key Benefits

- **AI-Optimized**: Provides rich context for AI agents to understand your data and generate accurate queries
- **Declarative**: Define business logic once in YAML, use it everywhere
- **Consistent**: Ensures everyone in your organization uses the same metric definitions
- **Governed**: Centralize data access, security, and quality rules
- **Portable**: Works across different BI tools and query engines

## Core Concepts

The semantic layer consists of four main building blocks:

### Views

**Views** represent logical data models that define how to access and interpret data. They encapsulate the business logic needed to transform raw tables into meaningful business concepts.

A view defines:
- How to access data (table or custom SQL)
- What entities exist in the data
- Available dimensions (attributes)
- Available measures (metrics and aggregations)

[Learn more about Views →](/learn-about-oxy/semantic-layer/views)

### Entities

**Entities** represent distinct objects or concepts in your data model (like customers, orders, or products). They enable automatic relationship discovery and intelligent joins between views.

### Dimensions

**Dimensions** are attributes that describe your entities. They're used for grouping, filtering, and segmenting data (like order status, customer name, or product category).

[Learn more about Dimensions →](/learn-about-oxy/semantic-layer/dimensions)

### Measures

**Measures** are quantitative calculations and aggregations that provide business insights (like total revenue, average order value, or customer count).

[Learn more about Measures →](/learn-about-oxy/semantic-layer/measures)

### Topics

**Topics** are collections of related views organized by business domain. They help users discover and explore related data concepts together.

## Project Structure

Organize your semantic layer files in a clear directory structure:

```
your-project/
├── config.yml
├── semantics/
│   ├── topics/
│   │   ├── sales.topic.yml
│   │   ├── marketing.topic.yml
│   │   └── finance.topic.yml
│   └── views/
│       ├── orders.view.yml
│       ├── customers.view.yml
│       ├── products.view.yml
│       └── campaigns.view.yml
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```yaml semantics/views/orders.view.yml
name: orders
description: "Order transactions and related data"
datasource: "local"
table: "orders.csv"

entities:
  - name: order
    type: primary
    key: order_id

dimensions:
  - name: order_date
    type: date
    expr: order_date
  
  - name: order_status
    type: string
    expr: status
    samples: ["pending", "shipped", "delivered"]

measures:
  - name: total_orders
    type: count
    
  - name: total_revenue
    type: sum
    expr: total_amount
```

Build your semantic layer:

```bash
oxy build
```

Then use it in an agent:

```yaml agents/analyst.agent.yml
model: "openai-4o-mini"
tools:
  - name: semantic_query
    type: semantic_query
    topic: sales
```

## Examples

### Performance

- Use table references when possible instead of complex SQL
- Pre-aggregate data in SQL-based views when appropriate
- Index the key columns referenced in entity definitions

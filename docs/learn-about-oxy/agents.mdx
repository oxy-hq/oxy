A data agent is an LLM-based agent that can reason about enterprise data. The data agent and the agent configs that define them are at the heart of oxy.&#x20;

Typically, to prompt engineer a *data* agent (an agent that can reason around
data), you need a heavily manual workflow involving database schema ingestion,
LLM prompting and step chaining/iteration, and SQL query retrieval and
injection. Our `.agent.yml` files abstract away much of this complexity,
allowing you to focus more on the *logic* of the prompted LLM rather than the
details of the code execution.&#x20;

# Agent components

Specifically, in our agent `yml` files, you need to specify the following:

| Component            | Description                                                                                | Required |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| model                | LLM model to use (defined in [config.yml](/learn-about-oxy/config), referenced by `name`) | Required |
| system\_instructions | System instructions passed to the LLM                                                      | Required |
| context              | A list of files that can be injected into `system_instructions`                            | Optional |
| tools                | Tools to use, see the Tools section below                                                  | Optional |
| database             | Database to use (defined in [config.yml](/learn-about-oxy/config), referenced by `name`)  | Optional |

## Context

The context object allows for deterministic injection of files into
`system_instructions`. Primarily this is an organizational and code re-use
utility so rather than prompting your agents with long text blobs, you can
instead divide these prompts into logical sections, broken into distinct files.
Each context entry in the list requires three fields:

| Field | Description                                                                       | Example             |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| name  | Identifier for the context that will be used in system\_instructions              | "anon\_youtube"     |
| type  | Type of the context file (e.g., file, semantic\_model)                            | "semantic\_model"   |
| src   | Path to the source file relative to the project root (can be single file or list) | "data/acme.sem.yml" |

You can reference `file`-type context objects in your system\_instructions using the following syntax:
`{{ context.name }}`
For objects that are of type `semantic_model`, you can access their properties using:
`{{ context.name.property }}`
For example, if you have a semantic model context named "acme", you can access its entities using:
`{{ context.acme.entities }}`

For smaller projects, we encourage saving any pertinent SQL files and injecting
these in as context objects, rather than opting for leveraging retrieval to
pull in relevant sources. We find that this tends to provide much more
deterministic outputs.

This can be accomplished by adding the following section to an `.agent.yml file`:

```yaml
context:
  - name: queries
    type: file
    src:
      - "*.sql"
```

which can then be referenced within `system_instructions` as follows:

```yaml
prompt: |
  Here are some queries you can use:
  {{ context.queries }}
```

## Tools

To enable the LLM to flexibly accomplish a wider range of tasks, our internal chain logic is as follows:

1. We render your `system_instructions` using all retrieved queries and context.

2. We feed the rendered `system_instructions` and prompt into the LLM tool calling API.

3. We repeat steps 1 and 2 with the results of step 2 until the request specified in `system_instructions` is fulfilled.

To improve the capacity of the LLM to accomplish specific tasks, you can add a
`tools` section with specific tools that can be used by the agent. The following tools are available:

### type: `execute_sql` / `validate_sql`

There are two kinds of sql-writing tools -- `execute_sql`, which will execute
the sql and return the results to the LLM, and `validate_sql`, which will
attempt to write queries until the query successful executes, sending only the
query itself back to the LLM (not the result set).

Both can be configured by specifying a `database` to connect to, as shown below:

```yaml
  - name: execute_sql  # any name you'd like
    type: execute_sql
    database: primary_database
```

```yaml
  - name: validate_sql  # any name you'd like 
    type: validate_sql
    database: primary_database
```

### type: `retrieval`

While we generally recommend avoid using retrieval (and instead using
`context`) to avoid injecting additional nondeterminism into the system, we do
support in-process retrieval against embeddings. The `retrieval` tool spins up
an in-process vector db and can be configured as follows:

```yaml
  - name: retrieval
    type: retrieval
    src:
      - "data/*"
```

where `src` specifies the directory that will be searched through and embedded.

To use this tool, embeddings must be built before any `oxy run` command. To
learn about how to build embeddings, see [Embedding
management](/reference/oxy-commands#embedding-management). In short, you'll
need to log into the huggingface CLI, then build embeddings using the following
command:

```yaml
oxy build
```

Additional parameters can be supplied as follows:

```yaml
  - name: retrieval
    type: retrieval
    src:
      - "data/*"
    # embed_model: text-embedding-3-small
    # api_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    # key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
    # api_key: secret
    # n_dims: 512
    # top_k: 4
    # factor: 5
```

<Warning>
  The accepted format of these parameters will likely change in the future.
</Warning>

## Database

Database information can be accessed within `system_instructions` by using the `databases` namespace, then referencing by `name`, as follows:

```
**Dataset: {{ databases.primary_database[0].dataset }}**
**Dialect: {{ databases.primary_database[0].dialect }}**
**Tables:**
{% for table in databases.primary_database[0].tables %}
{{ table }}
{% endfor %}
```

This will render the database name, dialect, and all tables in the database.

Note that for cases where multiple datasets are present, you should loop through the datasets and tables as follows:

```
{% for dataset in databases.primary_database %}
**Dataset: {{ dataset.dataset }}**
**Dialect: {{ dataset.dialect }}**
**Tables:**
{% for table in dataset.tables %}
{{ table }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

## Sample config

```yaml semantic_model.agent.yml
model: "openai-4.1-mini"
context:
  - name: anon_youtube
    type: semantic_model
    src: data/acme.sem.yml
system_instructions: |
  ## Instructions
  You are a Data Analyst expert. Your role is to assist the user in generating and executing SQL queries to answer their questions.
  ### Adhere to these rules:
  - **Carefully analyze the user's question and the database schema, word by word**, to ensure the query accurately addresses the request.
  - **Use table aliases** to avoid ambiguity in queries. For example: `SELECT t1.col1, t2.col1 FROM table1 AS t1 JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id`.
  - **Automatically execute the SQL query** without seeking additional confirmation.
  - If the SQL query results in an error, **attempt to debug, fix, and re-execute it** without requesting confirmation.
  - Ensure the SQL query adheres to the **specific dialect of the database database** being used.
  - **Return the SQL query as plain text** (not in JSON format).

  **Schema information:**
  Entities:
  {{ context.acme.entities }}
  Dimensions:
  {{ context.acme.dimensions }}
  Measures:
  {{ context.acme.measures }}

  **Dataset: {{ databases.primary_database[0].dataset }}**
  **Dialect: {{ databases.primary_database[0].dialect }}**
  **Tables:**
  {% for table in databases.primary_database[0].tables %}
  {{ table }}
  {% endfor %}

  You can use the following queries as hints:
  {{ tools.retrieval }}

tools:
  - name: retrieval
    type: retrieval
    src:
      - "data/*"
  - name: execute_sql
    type: execute_sql
    database: local
```

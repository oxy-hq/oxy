# Data Apps

A data app is a configuration-based visualization tool that allows you to create interactive dashboards from SQL queries without writing complex frontend code. 

## What are Data Apps?

Data apps in Oxy are defined using YAML configuration files (`.app.yml`) that specify both the data processing tasks and how to visualize the results.

<Callout type="info">
  Data apps are designed to make it simple to transform SQL query results into meaningful visualizations with minimal effort. The `.app.yml` files abstract away the complexity of building dashboards, allowing you to focus on the data and insights rather than visualization code.
</Callout>

## Data App Components

In a data app YAML file, you need to specify the following components:

| Component | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | Unique identifier for the data app | Required |
| description | Brief explanation of the app's purpose | Optional |
| tasks | SQL queries that prepare data for visualization | Required |
| display | Visualization components to render the data | Required |

### Tasks

The `tasks` section defines SQL queries that will extract and transform data from your databases. Each task has the following structure:

| Field | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | Identifier for the task (referenced in display) | Required |
| type | The task type (currently only `execute_sql` is supported) | Required |
| database | Database connection to use (defined in config.yml) | Required |
| sql_query | Inline SQL query to execute | Required if sql_file not provided |
| sql_file | Path to SQL file to execute | Required if sql_query not provided |
| variables | Key-value pairs for variable substitution in queries | Optional |
| cache | Cache configuration for query results | Optional |
| export | Configuration for exporting query results | Optional |

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your tasks are named uniquely as these names are referenced in the display section.
</Callout>

### Display

The `display` section defines how to visualize the data produced by your tasks. Several visualization types are supported:

<Tabs/>
  <TabItem value="markdown" label="Markdown"/>
    Markdown blocks can be used to add formatted text, headers, and documentation:

```yaml
- type: markdown

description: "Store intermediate task results for efficiency"

## Overview

The cache feature enables workflows to store intermediate task results, enhancing efficiency and reducing redundant computations.

### Configuration

- Configure caching at task level using the `cache` property.
- Enable caching with the `enabled` field.
- Specify the cache location with the `path` field. Jinja templates can be used to dynamically generate paths.
- The cache format can be `sql` or `json`, depending on the task type (whether it generates SQL or JSON output - JSON is commonly used for structured output from the agent).

## Core Components

| Field   | Description                          | Required |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| enabled | Boolean to enable or disable caching | Yes      |
| path    | File path for cached results         | Yes      |

## Example

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: sql
    type: agent
    cache:
      enabled: true
      path: output/cache/groupings_{{grouping_value}}.sql
```
### Referencing Cached Queries

You can cache generated queries in workflows and reference them in subsequent tasks using Jinja. For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: report
    type: agent
    prompt: |
      Generate a detail {{schedules.value}} report using {{metrics.value}} metrics:
      {{table}}. Retain the Jinja but treat it as if they are strings, so '{{ }}'.
    agent_ref: agents/local.agent.yml
    cache:
      path: output/agent.sql
  
  - name: metrics
    type: loop_sequential
    values:
      - "responses"
      - "rejected"
    steps:
      - name: report
        type: execute_sql
        sql_file: output/agent.sql
```

In this example:
- The `report` task generates a query and caches it in `output/agent.sql`.
- The `metrics` loop references the cached query in the `execute_sql` task.


## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Saves time by reusing cached results.
- **Reusability**: Cached data persists across runs.
- **Debugging**: Provides snapshots of intermediate outputs.
- **Task Interoperability**: Cached queries can be referenced in subsequent tasks, enabling seamless integration between tasks.

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive, unique paths to avoid conflicts.
2. Include the workflow name or a unique identifier as part of the cache file path to ensure clarity and avoid overwrites.
3. Regularly clean up outdated cache files.
4. Validate cached results for consistency.
5. Add the cache folder to `.gitignore` to avoid committing cached files.

A workflow is a series of tasks (`tasks`) executed sequentially. Each `task`
can be either a deterministic command (such as `execute_sql`, in which a named
sql query is executed) or an agent given a prompt. These tasks are composed by
passing results from one agent to the input of another -- the output of each
task can be accessed with Jinja as `{{ name_of_task }}`.

# Workflow components

Workflows are DAGs comprised of `tasks`. Each task has a few common properties:

| Component | Description                                                                  | Type     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| name      | Identifier for the task. Output of the task can be referenced as `{{name}}`. | required |
| type      | The tool to use for this task. See the following section for possible types. | required |

Specific task types have additional property requirements.

## `type: agent`

| Component | Description                                                                       | Type                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| agent\_ref | The agent to use within the `agents` directory, referenced by the agent's `name`. | required for `type: agent` |
| prompt    | The input prompt passed to the agent for this task.                               | required for `type: agent` |

## `type: execute_sql`

Executes a SQL query referenced by filename.

| Component | Description                                              | Type     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| sql\_file  | The sql file within the `data` directory to execute      | required |
| database  | The name of the `database` to execute the query against  | required |

## `type: formatter`

Formats the provided `template` using the outputs of other `tasks`, then passes
the rendered template as output.

| Component | Description                                       | Type     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| template  | The template to be rendered and passed as output. | required |

## `type: loop_sequential`

| Component | Description                                                                 | Type     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| values    | Values to iterate over for each `task` in the current task's `tasks` array. | required |
| tasks     | Defines the tasks to execute for each `value`.                              | required |

`values` are accessed within the `tasks` of the `loop_sequential` task as
`<name>.value`, where `<name>` is the name of the task. A sample partial config
is shown below:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: loop_through_animals
    type: loop_sequential
    values: ["whale", "dolphin", "shark"]
    tasks:
      - name: get_number_of_animals
        type: agent
        agent_ref: default
        prompt: |
          Get the number of {{ loop_through_animals.value }}s in the ocean.
```

### Seeding `values` with query results

The `values` can be seeded with the output from a previous `execute_sql` step,
as follows:

```yaml
  - name: get_all_animals
    type: execute_sql
    sql_file: outputs/cache/get_all_animals.sql
    database: local

  # Loop over every animal
  - name: loop_through_animals
    type loop_sequential
    values: "{{ get_all_animals.animal_name }}"  # `animal_name` is the column name to loop over
    tasks:
      ...
```

### Formatting loop outputs

Loops are also often combined with the `type: formatter` task, which can loop through
the resulting outputs and form them into a single string. The output from a
`loop_sequential` is an array of dictionaries for each `value`, where the keys
for each element of each dictionary is named according to the `task`'s' `name`
field. These can be accessed by using Jinja, by looping through the `{{ <loop_name> }}` variable (`{{ loop_through_animals }}` above).

An example of this behavior is shown below:

```yaml
- name: format_animal_report
  type: formatter
  template: |
    {% for animal in loop_through_animals %}
    {{ animal.get_number_of_animals }}
    {% endfor %}
```

### Concurrency

Concurrency can be added to the loop by using the `concurrency` key, with the
value specifying the number of concurrent threads to use.

```yaml
- name: loop_through_animals
  type: loop_sequential
  concurrency: 5
  values: ...
  tasks:
    ...
```

## `type: workflow`

| Component | Description                                                                           | Type     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| src       | Path to the workflow yml file to execute. Relative to the root of the oxy directory. | required |
| variables | Variables that are passed through, overriding the sub-workflow's variables.           | optional |

Allows a sub-workflow to be executed. It's recommended to use this to break up
complex workflows into smaller, easily testable chunks. The `variables` key
here allows for parameterization of these workflows by overriding the
workflow-level variables. This can be particularly useful when embedding a
workflow task into a loop, as follows:

```yaml
  - name: loop_brands
    type: loop_sequential
    values: ["brand1", "brand2"]
    concurrency: 10
    tasks:
      - name: brand_stats
        type: workflow
        src: brand_stats.workflow.yml
        variables:
          brand_rollup: "{{ loop_brands.value }}"
```

# Variables

It's often the case that you may want to parameterize a workflow -- for
example, if you are trying to build an automated analysis, and want this to be
modular with respect to the date. We enable this behavior through the use of
the `variables` key.

```yaml
variables:
  brand: Underbelly
```

Each entry of `variables` should be specified as a key-value pair, and these
variables can be referenced within task fields by name using Jinja as follows:

```yaml
    {{ brand }}
```

# Examples

```yaml workflows/monthly_report.yml
tasks:
  - name: raw_sql_calculation
    type: execute_sql
    sql_file: month_over_month_overall_performance.sql # A sql file to execute deterministically
  - name: month_over_month_metrics # An identifier for the task. Results can be referenced by jinja-wrapping this name
    type: agent
    agent_ref: default # The agent .yml file to use for this task
    prompt: Calculate month-over-month performance of views and clicks for the entire ad portfolio. # The prompt given to the agent
  - name: monthly_report
    type: agent
    agent_ref: local
    prompt: |
      Create a report using the provided data that looks as follows:
      The overall portfolio brought in X views and Y clicks in MM/YYYY, up A% and B%, respectively.
      {{month_over_month_metrics}}
```

# Workflows vs. chains

A workflow is similar to a "chain" in the prompt engineering parlance, but with
a few key differences:

*   **Workflows are DAGs.** Whereas chains can become arbitrarily complex with
    arbitrarily nested loops, complex reply logic, and opaque branching structures,
    workflows are DAGs, which enforce a clearer, more predictable flow from input
    to output.
*   **Workflows separate logic from execution.** Because workflows are written in
    yaml, the DAG definition is entirely separate from the execution engine
    (usually Python), while other Python-based systems keep these tightly coupled
    and so ultimately become difficult to build and maintain.

These choices generally reduce the flexibility of Oxy when compared to say,
`langchain` or `llama_index`, but they also dramatically reduce the complexity
of the system. You can think of Oxy's `workflow` paradigm as a domain-specific
chain-builder for data workflows, where most (if not all) tasks simply pass
results around between different agents.

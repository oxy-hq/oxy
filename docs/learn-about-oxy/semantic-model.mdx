## Overview

A semantic model is a conceptual representation of data that defines business
terms, metrics, relationships, and rules in a way that makes sense to business
users. It's essentially a blueprint that maps raw data into business-friendly
concepts. Think of it like translating technical database schemas into business
terminology.

### Organization and Formatting Rules

- A semantic model should be organized under the `data` folder.
- Use the `.sem.yml` extension to distinguish it from other files in the `data` folder. e.g. `finance.sem.yml`

## Core Components

Let's take a look at Semantic model components:

| Component        | Description                                                     | Required |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| table            | Specifies the source table                                      | Required |
| database         | The database that the table is used within                      | Required |
| description      | A description of the table                                      | Required |
| entities         | Represents unique identifiers that define the grain of analysis | Required |
| dimensions       | Defines attributes used to slice and filter data                | Required |
| measures         | Defines business metrics with specific aggregation rules        | Required |

Within the `entities`, `dimensions`, and `measures` keys, the following fields are allowed:

| Component        | Description                                                     | Required |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| name             | Column name                                                     | Required |
| description      | Description of the column                                       | Optional |
| synonyms         | Synonyms for this column                                        | Optional |
| sample           | A sample of values for this column                              | Optional |

Moreover, for the `measures` key, the following fields attributes are available:

| Component        | Description                                                     | Required |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| sql | Snippet of SQL that defines the calculation. For pre-aggregated data, this can just be a column name. | Required |

## Sample semantic model config

The following example displays a complete configuration:

```yaml data/anon_youtube.sem.yml
table: content_level_monthly_stats_fruits_veggies.csv
database: local
description: Lorem ipsum

entities:
  - name: content_id
    description: content_id
    sample: [1, 2, 3, 4]

dimensions:
  - name: month
    sample:
      - "2024-08"
  - name: property_grouping
    synonyms:
      - "property_grouping"
    sample:
      - "Fruit"
      - "Vegetable"

measures:
  - name: count_content_id
    sql: sum(distinct content_id)
```

## How to enable use of semantic model in agents

For agents to utilize the semantic model, you need to include the semantic model in the `context` section of your agent config.

```yaml
context:
  - name: anon_youtube_model
    type: semantic_model
    src: data/anon_youtube.sem.yml
```

For more information, refer to context objects in the [Agents](/learn-about-oxy/agents#context) documentation.

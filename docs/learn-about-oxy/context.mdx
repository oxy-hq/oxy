## Prompt injection with `context`

Any additional context you'd like to provide to your LLM can be added in adding
the `context` section to your `.agent.yml` file, as shown below:

```
context:
  - name: files
    type: file
    src:
      - "*.txt"
```

This means that SQL files can be added to your oxy repository as plain `.sql`
files, then supplied to the agent using the `context` object.

```
context:
  - name: queries
    type: file
    src:
      - "*.sql"
```

You can then reference these within the `system_instructions` using Jinja, as follows:

```
{{ context.queries }}
```

where `queries` references the `name` given in the `context` field.

## Best practices for SQL

For SQL queries, in particular, at the top of these files, you should generally
add a comment that describes what the query does (we call this "front matter"
internally).

<Warning>
  The accepted format of this front matter will likely change in the future.
</Warning>

```sql
/*
 * The following query gets the date range over which the data is available.
 */

select
  min(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m', month)) as min_date,
  max(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m', month)) as max_date
from 'user_events.csv';
```

## Retrieval configuration

To configure data instead for retrieval, see the
[agents](agents#type-retrieval) section.

## Overview

**Measures** are quantitative calculations and aggregations that provide business insights (like total revenue, average order value, or customer count).

Measures enable you to analyze and aggregate your data in meaningful ways, providing the "what" to your dimensions' "how."

## Basic Measures

### Count

Count the number of records:

```yaml
measures:
  # Simple count
  - name: total_orders
    type: count
    description: "Total number of orders"
    synonyms: ["order_count", "number_of_orders"]

  # Count is the only measure type that doesn't require 'expr'
  - name: total_records
    type: count
    description: "Total number of records in the view"
```

### Sum

Sum numeric values:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    type: sum
    description: "Total revenue from all orders"
    expr: total_amount
    synonyms: ["revenue", "sales", "total_sales"]

  - name: total_quantity
    type: sum
    description: "Total quantity of items sold"
    expr: quantity
```

### Average

Calculate the arithmetic mean:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: avg_order_value
    type: average
    description: "Average order value"
    expr: total_amount
    synonyms: ["aov", "average_order_amount", "mean_order_value"]

  - name: avg_rating
    type: average
    description: "Average product rating"
    expr: rating
```

### Min/Max

Find minimum or maximum values:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: min_order_amount
    type: min
    description: "Smallest order amount"
    expr: total_amount

  - name: max_order_amount
    type: max
    description: "Largest order amount"
    expr: total_amount

  - name: first_order_date
    type: min
    description: "Date of first order"
    expr: order_date

  - name: last_order_date
    type: max
    description: "Date of most recent order"
    expr: order_date
```

### Count Distinct

Count unique values:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: unique_customers
    type: count_distinct
    description: "Number of unique customers"
    expr: customer_id
    synonyms: ["customer_count", "distinct_customers"]

  - name: unique_products
    type: count_distinct
    description: "Number of unique products sold"
    expr: product_id
```

### Median

Calculate the median value:

```yaml
measures:
  - name: median_order_value
    type: median
    description: "Median order value"
    expr: total_amount

  - name: median_delivery_days
    type: median
    description: "Median delivery time in days"
    expr: delivery_days
```

## Filtered Measures

Apply filters to create conditional aggregations:

```yaml
measures:
  # Large orders (>= $1000)
  - name: large_orders_count
    type: count
    description: "Number of large orders (>= $1000)"
    filters:
      - expr: "{{total_amount}} >= 1000"

  # Completed orders only
  - name: completed_orders_revenue
    type: sum
    description: "Revenue from completed orders"
    expr: total_amount
    filters:
      - expr: "{{order_status}} = 'completed'"

  # High-value customer revenue
  - name: high_value_customer_revenue
    type: sum
    description: "Revenue from high-value customers"
    expr: total_amount
    filters:
      - expr: "{{customer.value_segment}} = 'High Value'"

  # Male customers
  - name: male_customers
    type: count
    description: "Count of male customers"
    filters:
      - expr: "{{gender}} = 'M'"

  # Multiple conditions
  - name: premium_shipped_orders
    type: count
    description: "Premium orders that have shipped"
    filters:
      - expr: "{{shipping_method}} = 'Premium'"
      - expr: "{{order_status}} = 'shipped'"
```

## Custom Measures

For complex calculations, use the `custom` type:

```yaml
measures:
  # Division with null handling
  - name: revenue_per_customer
    type: custom
    description: "Revenue per unique customer"
    expr: |
      SUM(total_amount) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 0)

  # Weighted average
  - name: weighted_avg_rating
    type: custom
    description: "Rating weighted by review count"
    expr: |
      SUM(rating * review_count) / NULLIF(SUM(review_count), 0)

  # Percentage calculation
  - name: conversion_rate
    type: custom
    description: "Conversion rate as percentage"
    expr: |
      (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN order_id IS NOT NULL THEN customer_id END) * 100.0) 
      / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 0)

  # Ratio
  - name: repeat_customer_rate
    type: custom
    description: "Percentage of customers with multiple orders"
    expr: |
      (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN total_orders > 1 THEN customer_id END) * 100.0)
      / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 0)

  # Conditional aggregation
  - name: net_promoter_score
    type: custom
    description: "Net Promoter Score (NPS)"
    expr: |
      (COUNT(CASE WHEN rating >= 9 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 
       - COUNT(CASE WHEN rating <= 6 THEN 1 END) * 100.0)
      / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0)
```

## Cross-Entity Measures

Reference dimensions or measures from related entities using `{{entity.field}}` syntax:

```yaml
# In orders.view.yml
measures:
  # Sum across related entity
  - name: total_order_item_quantity
    type: sum
    description: "Total quantity from all order items"
    expr: "{{ order_item.quantity }}"

  # Count from related entity
  - name: items_count
    type: count
    description: "Total number of items in orders"
    expr: "{{ order_item.order_item_id }}"

  # Custom calculation with related entities
  - name: avg_items_per_order
    type: custom
    description: "Average number of items per order"
    expr: |
      COUNT(DISTINCT {{ order_item.item_id }}) 
      / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT {{ order.order_id }}), 0)

  # Revenue per product
  - name: revenue_per_product
    type: custom
    description: "Average revenue per product"
    expr: |
      SUM({{ order.total_revenue }}) 
      / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT {{ product.product_id }}), 0)
```

## Best Practices

### Naming

- Use descriptive names that indicate the metric (e.g., `total_revenue`, `avg_order_value`)
- Prefix with aggregation type when helpful (e.g., `avg_`, `total_`, `max_`)
- Avoid technical prefixes like `msr_` or `measure_`

### Documentation

- Always provide clear descriptions
- Add synonyms for metrics commonly referenced with different terms
- Document any business rules or calculations
- Include example values when helpful

### Expression Design

- Always use `NULLIF` to prevent division by zero
- Handle NULL values appropriately in calculations
- Consider performance implications of complex expressions
- Test custom measures thoroughly

### Filtered Measures

- Use filtered measures instead of creating separate views
- Name filtered measures descriptively (e.g., `large_orders_count`)
- Document the filter conditions in the description
- Consider performance when applying multiple filters

## Common Patterns

### Revenue Metrics

```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    type: sum
    description: "Total revenue"
    expr: total_amount
    
  - name: avg_order_value
    type: average
    description: "Average order value"
    expr: total_amount
    
  - name: revenue_per_customer
    type: custom
    description: "Average revenue per customer"
    expr: SUM(total_amount) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 0)
    
  - name: gross_margin
    type: custom
    description: "Gross margin as percentage"
    expr: ((SUM(revenue) - SUM(cost)) / NULLIF(SUM(revenue), 0)) * 100
```

### Customer Metrics

```yaml
measures:
  - name: total_customers
    type: count_distinct
    description: "Total unique customers"
    expr: customer_id
    
  - name: new_customers
    type: count_distinct
    description: "New customers (first order)"
    expr: customer_id
    filters:
      - expr: "{{is_first_order}} = true"
    
  - name: repeat_customers
    type: count_distinct
    description: "Customers with multiple orders"
    expr: customer_id
    filters:
      - expr: "{{total_orders}} > 1"
    
  - name: customer_retention_rate
    type: custom
    description: "Percentage of repeat customers"
    expr: |
      (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN total_orders > 1 THEN customer_id END) * 100.0)
      / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 0)
```

### Product Performance

```yaml
measures:
  - name: units_sold
    type: sum
    description: "Total units sold"
    expr: quantity
    
  - name: avg_unit_price
    type: average
    description: "Average unit price"
    expr: unit_price
    
  - name: inventory_turnover
    type: custom
    description: "Inventory turnover ratio"
    expr: SUM(quantity_sold) / NULLIF(AVG(inventory_quantity), 0)
    
  - name: sell_through_rate
    type: custom
    description: "Sell-through rate as percentage"
    expr: |
      (SUM(quantity_sold) * 100.0) 
      / NULLIF(SUM(quantity_available), 0)
```

### Time-Based Metrics

```yaml
measures:
  - name: avg_fulfillment_days
    type: average
    description: "Average days from order to fulfillment"
    expr: DATEDIFF(day, order_date, fulfillment_date)
    
  - name: max_delivery_days
    type: max
    description: "Maximum delivery time"
    expr: DATEDIFF(day, order_date, delivery_date)
    
  - name: on_time_delivery_rate
    type: custom
    description: "Percentage of on-time deliveries"
    expr: |
      (COUNT(CASE WHEN delivery_date <= promised_date THEN 1 END) * 100.0)
      / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0)
```

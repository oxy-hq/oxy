## Overview

**Topics** are collections of related views organized by business domain. They help users discover and explore related data concepts together, and provide a way to apply default filters and configurations across multiple views.

## Creating Topics

Create a file with the `.topic.yml` extension in your `semantics/topics/` directory:

```yaml semantics/topics/sales.topic.yml
name: sales
description: "Sales transactions, revenue, and performance analytics"
views:
  - orders
  - order_items
  - customers
  - products
```

## Topic Properties

| Property          | Type   | Required | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `name`            | string | Yes      | Unique identifier for the topic            |
| `description`     | string | Yes      | Description of the business domain         |
| `views`           | array  | Yes      | List of view names in this topic           |
| `base_view`       | string | No       | Specify a base view for query optimization |
| `default_filters` | array  | No       | Default filters applied to all queries     |

## Base View

The `base_view` property allows you to specify a primary view that serves as the foundation for queries within the topic. This helps optimize query performance and provides better context for AI agents when generating queries.

### When to Use Base View

Use a base view when:

- **One view is central**: Your topic has a primary fact table that other views join to
- **Query optimization**: You want to guide the query engine on which view to start from
- **Agent guidance**: You want to provide AI agents with context about the primary entity

### Example with Base View

```yaml semantics/topics/sales.topic.yml
name: sales
description: "Sales transactions, revenue, and performance analytics"
base_view: orders
views:
  - orders
  - order_items
  - customers
  - products
```

In this example, `orders` is the base view because most sales queries start from orders and join to related entities like customers and products.

### Benefits

- **Performance**: Queries start from the most logical table, reducing unnecessary joins
- **Context**: AI agents understand which entity is primary when generating queries
- **Consistency**: Ensures queries follow a consistent pattern

<Note>
  The `base_view` must be included in the `views` array. If specified, it
  provides a hint to the query engine but doesn't restrict which views can be
  queried.
</Note>

## Default Filters

You can apply default filters to a topic that will be automatically applied to every query. This is useful for:

- **Business rules**: Apply standard business logic (e.g., only active records)
- **Time-based filtering**: Default to recent data (e.g., last 90 days)
- **Multi-tenancy**: Filter to specific tenants or organizations

Default filters use the same syntax as query filters and support all filter operators.

### Active Records Only

```yaml semantics/topics/active_customers.topic.yml
name: active_customers
description: "Analytics for active customers only"
views:
  - customers
  - orders
default_filters:
  - field: customers.status
    filter_type:
      eq:
        value: "active"
  - field: customers.deleted_at
    filter_type:
      eq:
        value: null
```

### Recent Data Filter

```yaml semantics/topics/recent_sales.topic.yml
name: recent_sales
description: "Sales data for last 90 days"
views:
  - orders
  - order_items
default_filters:
  - field: orders.order_date
    filter_type:
      in_date_range:
        from: "90 days ago"
        to: "now"
```

### Multiple Filter Conditions

```yaml semantics/topics/high_value_completed_orders.topic.yml
name: high_value_completed_orders
description: "Completed orders over $1000"
views:
  - orders
  - customers
default_filters:
  - field: orders.order_status
    filter_type:
      eq:
        value: "completed"
  - field: orders.total_amount
    filter_type:
      gte:
        value: 1000
```

### Multi-Tenancy

```yaml semantics/topics/tenant_analytics.topic.yml
name: tenant_analytics
description: "Analytics scoped to a specific tenant"
views:
  - orders
  - customers
  - products
default_filters:
  - field: orders.tenant_id
    filter_type:
      eq:
        value: "tenant_abc123"
```

## Filter Operators

Default filters support all standard operators:

| Operator            | Description           | Example                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `eq`                | Equals                | `field: status, eq: { value: "active" }`                                   |
| `neq`               | Not equals            | `field: status, neq: { value: "deleted" }`                                 |
| `gt`                | Greater than          | `field: amount, gt: { value: 100 }`                                        |
| `gte`               | Greater than or equal | `field: amount, gte: { value: 100 }`                                       |
| `lt`                | Less than             | `field: amount, lt: { value: 1000 }`                                       |
| `lte`               | Less than or equal    | `field: amount, lte: { value: 1000 }`                                      |
| `in`                | In array              | `field: status, in: { values: ["pending", "processing"] }`                 |
| `not_in`            | Not in array          | `field: status, not_in: { values: ["cancelled", "failed"] }`               |
| `in_date_range`     | Within date range     | `field: date, in_date_range: { from: "2024-01-01", to: "2024-12-31" }`     |
| `not_in_date_range` | Outside date range    | `field: date, not_in_date_range: { from: "2024-01-01", to: "2024-12-31" }` |

<Note>
  Default filters are applied with **AND** logic along with any user-provided
  filters. This means all default filters must be satisfied in addition to any
  filters specified in the query.

## Best Practices

### Organization

- Group related views that are commonly queried together
- Create topics aligned with business domains or departments
- Keep topics focused—avoid including unrelated views

### Naming

- Use descriptive names that reflect the business domain
- Use lowercase with underscores for consistency
- Consider the end-user perspective when naming

### Default Filters

- Use default filters for consistent business logic
- Document why default filters are applied
- Be mindful of performance implications
- Test queries with default filters enabled

### Documentation

- Provide clear descriptions of the topic's scope
- Document which views are included and why
- Explain any default filters and their purpose

## Using Topics

Topics are used in three main ways:

### 1. In Agents

```yaml agents/analytics.agent.yml
tools:
  - name: semantic_query
    type: semantic_query
    topic: ecommerce_analytics
```

### 2. In Workflows

```yaml workflows/sales_report.workflow.yml
tasks:
  - name: sales_metrics
    type: semantic_query
    topic: sales
    dimensions:
      - orders.order_date
    measures:
      - orders.total_revenue
```

### 3. In Routing Agents

```yaml agents/_routing.agent.yml
routes:
  - "semantics/topics/sales.topic.yml"
  - "semantics/topics/marketing.topic.yml"
  - "semantics/topics/*.topic.yml" # Include all topics
```

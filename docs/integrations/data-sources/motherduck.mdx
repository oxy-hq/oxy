title: MotherDuck
---

A `motherduck` database entry can be added by specifying `type: motherduck` in your
[`~/.config/oxy/config.yml` file](/learn-about-oxy/config).
This integration allows Oxy to query databases hosted in MotherDuck, the cloud-based DuckDB platform, using your authentication token.

# Required fields

Each `motherduck` entry requires the following fields:

- **`token_var`** – The name of the environment variable that stores your MotherDuck authentication token.
- **`type`** – Must be set to `motherduck`.

# Optional fields

- **`database`** – The name of the specific MotherDuck database to connect to. If omitted, connects to your default database.
- **`schemas`** – A map of schema names to table patterns for filtering which schemas/tables to sync. Each key is a schema name, and the value is an array of table patterns (use `["*"]` for all tables in that schema). If omitted, all schemas will be synced.

# Authentication

Oxy connects to MotherDuck using an authentication token.
You should store this token as an environment variable and reference it via `token_var`.
For example, if your variable is `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`, make sure it's exported in your environment before running any queries:

```bash
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN="your_motherduck_token_here"
```

Alternatively, you can add it to your `.env` file:
```bash
echo MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=your_motherduck_token_here >> .env
```

To obtain a MotherDuck token, visit the [MotherDuck console](https://app.motherduck.com/) and generate an API token from your account settings.

# Sample config entries

## Connect to default database
```yaml
databases:
  - name: motherduck
    type: motherduck
    token_var: MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN
```

## Connect to specific database
```yaml
databases:
  - name: motherduck_analytics
    type: motherduck
    token_var: MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN
    database: my_analytics_db  # replace with your database name
```

## Filter by specific schemas
```yaml
databases:
  - name: motherduck_filtered
    type: motherduck
    token_var: MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN
    database: my_analytics_db
    schemas:
      main: ["*"]              # sync all tables from 'main' schema
      analytics: ["users", "events"]  # sync only specific tables from 'analytics' schema
```

# Usage notes
- MotherDuck uses the DuckDB SQL dialect, so all DuckDB features and functions are available.
- Queries are executed in the cloud and results are streamed back to Oxy.
- You can query both cloud-based tables and local files using DuckDB's hybrid execution model.
- MotherDuck provides automatic caching and optimization for better query performance.
- **Schema sync**: Use `oxy sync` to automatically generate semantic models from your MotherDuck database schema.

# Syncing your schema

You can automatically generate semantic models from your MotherDuck database schema using the `oxy sync` command:

```bash
oxy sync
```

This will:
1. Query your MotherDuck database's `information_schema` to discover all tables and columns
2. Generate semantic model YAML files in your project's configured location
3. Include table names, column names, and data types

To control which schemas and tables are synced, use the `schemas` field in your config:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: motherduck
    type: motherduck
    token_var: MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN
    database: exercise
    schemas:
      main: ["*"]           # sync all tables from main schema
      staging: ["orders"]   # sync only orders table from staging schema
```

You can also sync specific databases using command-line options:

```bash
# Sync only the motherduck database
oxy sync --database motherduck

# Sync with overwrite flag to replace existing files
oxy sync --overwrite
```

# Troubleshooting

- **Token issues**: Ensure your `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly and contains a valid token.
- **Database not found**: Verify the database name in your config matches an existing database in your MotherDuck account.
- **Connection errors**: Check your internet connectivity and verify you can access MotherDuck through their web console.
- **Sync issues**: If `oxy sync` fails, ensure your token has read permissions on the database schema.

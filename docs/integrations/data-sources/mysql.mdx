This tutorial will guide you through connecting to Mysql with Oxy. Note that the password should be stored in a file for security reasons.

## Step 1: Create the Password File

Create a file to store your Mysql password. For example, create a file named `password.txt` and add your password to it.

```sh
echo "your_password" > path/to/password.txt
```

## Step 2: Configure Mysql in `config.yml`

Add the Mysql configuration to your `config.yml` file. Use the following parameters:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: my_mysql_db
    type: mysql
    host: "localhost"
    port: "3306"
    user: "root"
    password_file: "path/to/password.txt"
    database: "default"
```

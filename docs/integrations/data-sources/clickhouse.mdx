This tutorial will guide you through connecting to ClickHouse with Oxy. Note that the password should be stored in a file for security reasons.

## Step 1: Create the Password File

Create a file to store your ClickHouse password. For example, create a file named `clickhouse_password.txt` and add your password to it.

```sh
echo "your_password" > path/to/clickhouse_password.txt
```

## Step 2: Configure ClickHouse in `config.yml`

Add the ClickHouse configuration to your `config.yml` file. Use the following parameters:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: my_clickhouse_db
    type: clickhouse
    host: "localhost"
    user: "default"
    password_file: "path/to/clickhouse_password.txt"
    database: "default"
```

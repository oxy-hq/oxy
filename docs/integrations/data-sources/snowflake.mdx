This guide explains how to connect to Snowflake with Oxy. Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that provides scalable storage and compute resources.

## Configuration Options

Add your Snowflake configuration to `config.yml`. Here are all available parameters:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: my_snowflake_db      # Unique identifier for this connection
    type: snowflake
    account: "xy12345"         # Your Snowflake account identifier
    username: "your_user"      # Username for authentication
    password: <password>       # Direct password (not recommended)
    password_var: "SF_PWD"     # Environment variable containing password (recommended)
    warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH"    # Warehouse to use
    database: "ANALYTICS"      # Database name
    role: "ANALYST"           # Optional: Role to assume
```

## Example Configurations
<Steps>
<Step title="Prepare password environment variable">

Export the environment variables
```sh
export SF_PWD=<your password>
```
Or put it in `.env` file
```sh
echo SF_PWD=<your password> >> .env
```

</Step>
<Step title="Add Snowflake configuration">

```yaml
databases:
  - name: snowflake_analytics
    type: snowflake
    account: "xy12345.us-east-1"
    username: "analyst"
    password_var: "SF_PWD"
    warehouse: "COMPUTE_WH"
    database: "ANALYTICS"
```

</Step>

## Troubleshooting

- Verify account identifier format (includes region if not US)
- Check warehouse exists and is running

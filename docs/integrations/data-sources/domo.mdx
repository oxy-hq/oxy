title: Domo
---

A `domo` database entry can be added by specifying `type: domo` in your
[`~/.config/oxy/config.yml` file](/learn-about-oxy/config).  
This integration allows Oxy to query datasets hosted in Domo directly through its API, using your developer token and dataset ID.

# Required fields

Each `domo` entry requires the following fields:

- **`dataset_id`** – The unique ID of your Domo dataset.  
- **`developer_token_var`** – The name of the environment variable that stores your Domo Developer Token.  
- **`instance`** – The Domo instance name (e.g., `oxygen-ai`).  
- **`type`** – Must be set to `domo`.

# Authentication

Oxy connects to Domo using a **Developer Token**.  
You should store this token as an environment variable and reference it via `developer_token_var`.  
For example, if your variable is `DOMO_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`, make sure it’s exported in your environment before running any queries:

```bash
export DOMO_DEVELOPER_TOKEN="your_domo_token_here"
```

# Sample config entry
```yaml
databases:
  - name: domo
    type: domo
    dataset_id: b7a2f6c3-5e19-4d0e-8c47-6a8c1de3f234  # replace with your actual dataset ID
    developer_token_var: DOMO_DEVELOPER_TOKEN
    instance: oxygen-ai # replace with your Domo instance name
```


# Usage notes
- Oxy retrieves data from the Domo dataset defined by `dataset_id`.
- Your developer token must have API access to this dataset.
- Queries are executed via the Domo API and streamed into Oxy’s runtime for downstream processing or caching.

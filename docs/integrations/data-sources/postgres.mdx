title: Postgres
---

This tutorial will guide you through connecting to PostgreSQL with Oxy. Note that the password should be stored inside a file for security reasons. Please don't hardcode the password in your code and don't check the password file into version control.

## Step 1: Create the Password File

Create a file to store your PostgreSQL password. For example, create a file named `password.txt` and add your password to it.

```sh
echo "your_password" > path/to/password.txt
```

## Step 2: Configure PostgreSQL in `config.yml`

Add the PostgreSQL configuration to your `config.yml` file. Use the following parameters:

```yaml
databases:
  - name: my_postgres_db
    type: postgres
    host: "localhost"
    port: "5432"
    user: "postgres"
    password_file: "path/to/password.txt"
    database: "my_database"
```

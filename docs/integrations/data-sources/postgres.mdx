This tutorial will guide you through connecting to PostgreSQL with Oxy. Note that the password and connection string should be stored inside a file for security reasons. Please don't hardcode the password or connection string in your code and don't check the password file into version control.

## Step 1: Create the Password File

Create a file to store your PostgreSQL password. For example, create a file named `password.txt` and add your password to it.

```sh
echo "your_password" > path/to/password.txt
```

## Step 2: Configure PostgreSQL in `config.yml`

Add the PostgreSQL configuration to your `config.yml` file. You can either use a connection string or specify individual connection parameters. Ensure that the password is stored in a separate file.

```yaml
databases:
  - name: my_postgres_db
    type: postgres
    host: "localhost"
    port: "5432"
    user: "postgres"
    password_file: "path/to/password.txt"
    database: "my_database"
```

## Alternatives: Create the Connection String File

If you prefer using a connection string, create a file to store your PostgreSQL connection string. For example, create a file named `connection_string.txt` and add your connection string to it.

```sh
echo "postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/my_database" > path/to/connection_string.txt
```

After which you can configure PostgreSQL with the connection string file in your `config.yml` file.

```yaml
databases:
  - name: my_postgres_db
    type: postgres
    connection_string_file: "path/to/connection_string.txt"
```

title: DuckDB
---

A `duckdb` database entry can be added by specifying `type: duckdb` in your
[`~/.config/onyx/config.yml` file](/learn-about-onyx/config). The `dataset`
field should point to the directory where your data is stored. We run `SET
file_search_path = '{}'` within duckdb against the path you provide before any
query.

# Sample config entry

```yaml
databases:
  - name: local
    type: duckdb
    dataset: /Users/robertyi/repos/onyx-kelihi/.db/
```

> ⚠️ DEPRECATION: Starting in Oxy v0.3, AWS Cognito (ALB-based) and Google IAP (classic and Cloud Run modes) have been removed. These pages remain for historical reference — see the release notes for migration guidance and recommended alternatives (use built-in auth or API keys).


# Authentication in Oxy

Oxy supports four authentication modes designed for different deployment scenarios.

## Authentication Modes

### Built-in Authentication (Default)
**Command**: `oxy serve --auth-mode built-in`

Self-contained authentication with email/password and optional Google OAuth.

- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Email verification via SMTP
- ✅ Works with or without load balancer
- ✅ Ideal for development and small deployments

### AWS Cognito
**Command**: `oxy serve --auth-mode cognito`

Enterprise authentication through AWS Cognito + Application Load Balancer.

- ✅ Enterprise SSO and MFA
- ✅ AWS-native integration
- ⚠️ Requires ALB setup
- ✅ Best for AWS production deployments

### Google IAP
**Command**: `oxy serve --auth-mode iap`

Zero-trust authentication via Google Identity-Aware Proxy.

- ✅ Google Workspace SSO
- ✅ Zero-trust security
- ⚠️ Requires GCP setup
- ✅ Best for Google Cloud deployments

### IAP Cloud Run
**Command**: `oxy serve --auth-mode iap-cloud-run`

Cloud Run optimized IAP with enhanced container security.

- ✅ Serverless-friendly
- ✅ Auto-scaling compatible
- ⚠️ Cloud Run specific
- ✅ Best for GCP serverless deployments

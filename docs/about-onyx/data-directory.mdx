The `data` directory contains two important objects: `.sql` files, which are SQL definitions of business entities, and folders, which can be used to segment the queries and give the agents a natural sense of scope (they will have access to specific folder(s)).

The `.sql` files have front-matter (TODO: define what the front-matter should look like, and build it into the code).

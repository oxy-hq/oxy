# Deploy Oxy on AWS

This guide walks you through deploying Oxy on Amazon EC2 instances with direct access. We'll cover everything from setting up a virtual machine to configuring Oxy with proper data persistence.

<Note>
  This guide sets up Oxy for direct access on port 3000. For production
  deployments, consider implementing additional security measures such as HTTPS
  with SSL certificates, authentication, and network access controls.
</Note>

<Note>
  This is part of our [Hands-on Deployment Guides](/deployment/hands-on). For
  additional deployment options, see our [Docker Deployment
  Guide](/deployment/docker) or the [general deployment
  overview](/deployment/overview).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An AWS account
- A domain name (optional, but recommended for production deployments)
- Basic familiarity with Linux command line

## Creating an EC2 Instance

Follow these steps to create an EC2 instance in Amazon Web Services:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access AWS Management Console">
    Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and sign in with your account.
  </Step>

<Step title="Navigate to EC2 Dashboard">
  From the services menu, select **EC2** under Compute services.
</Step>

  <Step title="Launch an Instance">
    Click the **Launch instance** button and configure your instance:

    - **Name**: Choose a name for your instance (e.g., `oxy-server`)
    - **Application and OS Images**:
      - Select Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (64-bit ARM or x86)
      - For best value, choose the ARM-based Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
    - **Instance type**:
      - For ARM-based, select `t4g.small` (2 vCPU, 2 GB memory) or `t4g.medium` (2 vCPU, 4 GB memory)
      - For x86-based, select `t3.small` (2 vCPU, 2 GB memory) or `t3.medium` (2 vCPU, 4 GB memory)
    - **Key pair**: Create a new key pair or select an existing one
      - If creating a new one, make sure to download and save the private key file
    - **Network settings**:
      - Allow SSH traffic from your IP
      - Allow HTTP traffic on port 3000 (custom TCP rule: TCP, Port 3000, Source: 0.0.0.0/0)
    - **Storage**:
      - Default 8 GB gp3 root volume is sufficient to start

    Click **Launch instance** to create your EC2 instance.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Your Public IP">
    Once your instance is running (it may take a minute), select it from the Instances list and note the Public IPv4 address. You'll need this to connect to your instance and to configure your domain DNS settings if using a custom domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pointing Your Domain to Your EC2 Instance (Optional)

If you have a domain name and want to use it with your Oxy deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access DNS Settings">
    Go to your domain registrar's website (such as Route 53, Namecheap, or GoDaddy) and navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add DNS Records">
    Add the following DNS record to point your domain to your EC2 instance:

    - **A Record**:
      - Host/Name: `@` or your subdomain (e.g., `oxy`)
      - Value/Points to: Your EC2 instance's public IP address
      - TTL: 3600 (or as recommended by your registrar)

    <Note>
      You can find your EC2 instance's public IP address in the AWS Console under EC2 → Instances.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for DNS Propagation">
    DNS changes can take from a few minutes to several hours to propagate. You can check the status using online tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up the EC2 Instance

Connect to your EC2 instance and prepare it for Oxy deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Your Instance">
    You can connect using the AWS EC2 Instance Connect from the AWS Console by selecting your instance and clicking "Connect", or use SSH with your key file:

    ```bash
    # Using SSH (replace with your key file path and public IP)
    ssh -i /path/to/your-key-file.pem ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
    ```

    <Important>
      The default user for Ubuntu instances on AWS is `ubuntu`. This guide assumes you're using this user account for all commands.
    </Important>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update System and Install Essential Packages">
    ```bash
    # Update package lists and install essential tools in one command
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl wget git unzip jq nano
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installing Oxy CLI

Let's install Oxy directly on the EC2 instance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Required Dependencies">
    ```bash
    # Install all necessary dependencies at once
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Oxy">
    Run the official Oxy installation script:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.oxy.tech)
    ```

    This script will download and install the latest stable version of Oxy.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Installation">
    Confirm that Oxy is installed correctly:

    ```bash
    oxy --version
    ```

    You should see the version information displayed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Oxy Workspace

Let's use the built-in `oxy init` command to initialize a new workspace with all the necessary files and configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Navigate to Workspace Directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/oxy-workspace
    cd ~/oxy-workspace
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Oxy Project">
    ```bash
    oxy init
    ```

    This interactive command will:
    1. Create a `config.yml` file with your database and model configurations
    2. Set up sample project files
    3. Create necessary directories like `agents` and `workflows`

    Follow the prompts to configure:
    - Database settings (You can start with DuckDB for simplicity)
    - Model configuration (e.g., OpenAI with your API key)

    The initialization process will ask for your OpenAI API key and create all the necessary configuration.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Alternative: Set Up Git and Clone Existing Project">
    <Note>
      If you already have an existing Oxy project in a Git repository, you should set up Git and clone your repository instead of using `oxy init`.
    </Note>

    First, make sure Git is properly configured:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```

    Then clone your existing repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-oxy-project.git ~/oxy-workspace
    cd ~/oxy-workspace
    ```

    This will give you your existing project configuration and agents, which is preferable to starting from scratch if you already have a working setup.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Data Directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/oxy-data
    ```

    This directory will store workspace files and semantic information for Oxy.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Create a standard `.env` file in the workspace directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~/oxy-workspace
    nano .env
    ```

    Add your environment variables:

    ```bash
    OXY_STATE_DIR=/home/$(whoami)/oxy-data
    ```

    Save and exit.

    <Note>
      If you don't set `OXY_STATE_DIR`, Oxy will use the default location `~/.local/share/oxy/`.
      We recommend setting it explicitly for production deployments to make backups and maintenance easier.
    </Note>

    Note: You won't need to manually set the OpenAI API key in the environment as it's already configured during the `oxy init` process.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up and Starting Oxy as a Service

Let's configure Oxy to run automatically on system startup and restart if it fails:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Systemd Service File">
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/oxy.service
    ```

    Add the following content:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Oxy Server
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=ubuntu
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/oxy-workspace
    EnvironmentFile=/home/ubuntu/oxy-workspace/.env
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/oxy serve --port 3000
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    <Note>
      We specify port 3000 explicitly to match the security group configuration. The service will be accessible directly on this port from the internet.
    </Note>

    This configuration uses the default `ubuntu` user which is standard on EC2 Ubuntu instances. If you're using a different username, adjust accordingly.

    Save and exit.

  </Step>

<Step title="Enable and Start the Service">
  ```bash sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable oxy sudo systemctl
  start oxy ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Service">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status oxy
    ```

    You should see that the service is active and running.

  </Step>

  <Step title="View Logs (if needed)">
    If you encounter any issues, check the logs:

    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u oxy -f
    ```

    This command will show you the live logs from the Oxy service.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Connection">
    You can test if Oxy is responding properly:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000
    ```

    You should get a positive response indicating that Oxy is running.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Deployment">
    You can now access your Oxy deployment using:

    If you've configured a domain name:
    ```
    http://yourdomain.com:3000
    ```

    Or directly using your EC2 instance's public IP:
    ```
    http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3000
    ```

    <Tip>
      For production deployments with HTTPS, consider setting up a reverse proxy like nginx with Let's Encrypt certificates, or implementing additional AWS services for SSL termination and enhanced security.
    </Tip>

    You should see the Oxy interface. Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully deployed Oxy on AWS EC2.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Group Configuration

To ensure your Oxy deployment is accessible, verify your EC2 instance's security group allows inbound traffic on port 3000:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Security Groups">
    In the AWS Management Console, go to **EC2** > **Security Groups**.
  </Step>

<Step title="Find Your Instance's Security Group">
  Locate the security group associated with your EC2 instance (you can find this
  in the instance details).
</Step>

<Step title="Add Inbound Rule for Port 3000">
  Edit the security group and add the following inbound rule: - **Type**: Custom
  TCP - **Port range**: 3000 - **Source**: 0.0.0.0/0 (for public access) or your
  specific IP range for restricted access - **Description**: Oxy HTTP access
</Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save rules** to apply the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Opening port 3000 to 0.0.0.0/0 allows public access to your Oxy instance. For
  production deployments, consider restricting access to specific IP ranges or
  implementing additional authentication measures.
</Warning>

# Optional Configuration and Management

Everything up to this point completes the core setup of your Oxy deployment. The following sections cover additional aspects of managing your deployment that you may want to explore as needed.

## Data Persistence

It's important to understand how Oxy handles data persistence:

- Oxy uses **PostgreSQL** for its data storage
- For production: Use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or a self-hosted PostgreSQL instance
- For development: Use `oxy start` to automatically set up PostgreSQL in Docker
- Configure the database connection via the `OXY_DATABASE_URL` environment variable

<Note>
  For production deployments on AWS:
  - Use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL for managed database service
  - Set up automated backups with RDS snapshots
  - Enable Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
  - Configure connection pooling for better performance

See our [Migration Guide](/migration/migration-guide) for detailed PostgreSQL setup instructions.

</Note>

## Managing Your Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stopping the Service">
    If you need to stop the Oxy service temporarily:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop oxy
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Updating Oxy">
    To update Oxy to the latest version:

    ```bash
    # Stop the service first
    sudo systemctl stop oxy

    # Run the installation script again
    bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.oxy.tech)

    # Start the service again
    sudo systemctl start oxy
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup Data">
    ```bash
    # Create a backup of your Oxy data
    tar -czf oxy-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/oxy-data/

    # Optional: Upload to Amazon S3
    aws s3 cp oxy-backup-*.tar.gz s3://your-bucket-name/
    ```

    You'll need the AWS CLI installed and configured for the last command.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Machine Recommendations

<Note>Oxy runs well with just 4GB of memory for most use cases.</Note>

Choose from these recommended instance types:

| Usage Level        | ARM-based (Best Value)                                                  | x86-based                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small (1-3 users)  | `t4g.small` (2 vCPU, 2 GB memory) or `t4g.medium` (2 vCPU, 4 GB memory) | `t3.small` (2 vCPU, 2 GB memory) or `t3.medium` (2 vCPU, 4 GB memory) |
| Medium (3-5 users) | `t4g.large` (2 vCPU, 8 GB memory)                                       | `t3.large` (2 vCPU, 8 GB memory)                                      |
| Large (5-15 users) | `t4g.xlarge` (4 vCPU, 16 GB memory)                                     | `t3.xlarge` (4 vCPU, 16 GB memory)                                    |

ARM-based instances (T4g series) typically offer 20% cost savings over equivalent x86-based instances with comparable or better performance.

## Scaling on AWS

As your usage grows, you may need to scale your deployment:

### Vertical Scaling

1. Stop your EC2 instance from the AWS Management Console
2. Change the instance type to a larger size (e.g., from t4g.small to t4g.medium)
3. Start the instance again
4. Reconnect and start your Oxy service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start oxy
   ```

### Storage Scaling

If you need more storage for your Oxy data:

1. Create a new EBS volume in the AWS Management Console:
   - Go to EC2 → Volumes → Create Volume
   - Choose a size and volume type (gp3 is recommended for balanced cost/performance)
   - Create in the same Availability Zone as your EC2 instance

2. Attach the volume to your EC2 instance:
   - Select the volume you created
   - Actions → Attach Volume
   - Select your instance and choose a device name (e.g., /dev/sdf)

3. Connect to your VM and mount the disk:

   ```bash
   # Check the volume name
   lsblk

   # Create a filesystem on the new volume (usually nvme1n1 on newer instances or xvdf on older ones)
   sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/nvme1n1

   # Mount the disk to a new location
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/oxy-data
   sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/oxy-data
   sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/oxy-data

   # Copy your existing data to the new location
   cp -r ~/oxy-data/* /mnt/oxy-data/

   # Update the data path in your .env file
   echo "OXY_STATE_DIR=/mnt/oxy-data" > ~/oxy-workspace/.env

   # Restart Oxy to use the new location
   sudo systemctl restart oxy
   ```

4. To make the mount persistent across reboots, add it to fstab:

   ```bash
   # Get the UUID of the volume
   sudo blkid

   # Add to fstab using the UUID
   echo "UUID=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/nvme1n1) /mnt/oxy-data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot access Oxy through the domain or public IP">
    - Check your EC2 instance security group: Ensure it allows inbound traffic on port 3000 from 0.0.0.0/0 (or your specific IP range)
    - Verify Oxy is running: `sudo systemctl status oxy`
    - Test local connection: `curl http://localhost:3000`
    - For domain issues: Run `dig yourdomain.com` to verify DNS is pointing to your EC2 instance's public IP
    - Check if your EC2 instance's public IP has changed (this can happen after stop/start)
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Oxy service won't start">
  - View detailed logs: `sudo journalctl -u oxy -f` - Verify environment file
  exists: `cat ~/oxy-workspace/.env` - Check service file: `sudo cat
  /etc/systemd/system/oxy.service` - Ensure workspace exists: `ls -la
  ~/oxy-workspace` - Verify Oxy binary is installed: `which oxy`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data not persisting between restarts">
  - Verify data directory exists: `ls -la ~/oxy-data` - Check environment
  variable is set: `grep OXY_STATE_DIR ~/oxy-workspace/.env` - If you didn't set
  `OXY_STATE_DIR`, check the default location: `ls -la ~/.local/share/oxy/` -
  Ensure proper permissions: `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu ~/oxy-data`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Instance stopped responding">
  - Check if you've hit CPU credit limits (t-series instances are burstable) -
  Consider upgrading to a larger instance type if consistently hitting limits -
  View system metrics in the AWS EC2 console to diagnose resource constraints -
  Check available disk space: `df -h`
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection refused or timeout errors">
    - Verify the EC2 instance is running in the AWS Console
    - Check if the security group allows traffic on port 3000
    - Ensure Oxy service is running: `sudo systemctl status oxy`
    - Test if the port is open: `sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :3000`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Once your AWS EC2 deployment is running:

1. Configure agents and workflows in your workspace
2. Set up regular backups for your data
3. Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for deploying configuration updates
4. Monitor your EC2 instance's resource usage and scale as needed

For more information on using Oxy, refer to the [main documentation](/welcome).

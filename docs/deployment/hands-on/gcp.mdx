# Deploy Oxy on GCP

This guide walks you through deploying Oxy on Google Cloud Platform using Compute Engine VM instances with direct access. We'll cover everything from setting up a virtual machine to configuring Oxy with proper data persistence.

<Note>
  This guide sets up Oxy for direct access on port 3000. For production deployments, consider implementing additional security measures such as HTTPS with SSL certificates, authentication, and network access controls.
</Note>

<Note>
  This is part of our [Hands-on Deployment Guides](/deployment/hands-on). For additional deployment options, see our [Docker Deployment Guide](/deployment/docker) or the [general deployment overview](/deployment/overview).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Google Cloud Platform account
- A domain name (optional, but recommended for production deployments)
- Basic familiarity with Linux command line

## Getting a VM Instance

Follow these steps to create a VM instance in Google Cloud Platform:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Google Cloud Console">
    Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create or Select a Project">
    Select an existing project or create a new one using the project selector at the top of the page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Compute Engine">
    From the navigation menu, select **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**.
    
    If this is your first time using Compute Engine, you might need to enable the API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a VM Instance">
    Click the **CREATE INSTANCE** button and configure your instance:
    
    - **Name**: Choose a name for your instance (e.g., `oxy-server`)
    - **Region & Zone**: Select a region close to your users
    - **Machine Configuration**: 
      - For optimal cost-performance, consider using ARM-based instances (T2A series):
        - `t2a-standard-1` (1 vCPU ARM, 4 GB memory)
    - **Boot disk**:
      - Operating System: Ubuntu
      - Version: Latest stable (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04)
      - Size: recommended starting point 10 GB
    - **Firewall**:
      - Check "Allow HTTP traffic" to allow access on port 3000
      - You may also check "Allow HTTPS traffic" if you plan to set up HTTPS later
    
    Click **Create** to provision your VM.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Note Your External IP">
    Once your VM is ready, note the External IP address displayed in the VM instances list. You'll need this to connect to your instance and to configure your domain DNS settings if using a custom domain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pointing Your Domain to the VM (Optional)

If you have a domain name you want to use for your Oxy deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access DNS Settings">
    Go to your domain registrar's website (such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains) and navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add DNS Records">
    Add the following DNS records:
    
    - **A Record**:
      - Host/Name: `@` (represents the root domain)
      - Value/Points to: Your VM's External IP address
      - TTL: 3600 (or as recommended by your registrar)
    
    - **A Record** for www subdomain:
      - Host/Name: `www`
      - Value/Points to: Your VM's External IP address
      - TTL: 3600 (or as recommended by your registrar)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for DNS Propagation">
    DNS changes can take from a few minutes to several hours to propagate. You can check the status using online tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up the VM

Connect to your VM instance and prepare it for Oxy deployment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Your VM">
    You can connect directly from the Google Cloud Console by clicking the "SSH" button next to your instance, or use a terminal:
    
    ```bash
    # If using gcloud CLI
    gcloud compute ssh --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID --zone=YOUR_ZONE oxy-server
    
    # Or using standard SSH if you've set up SSH keys
    ssh username@EXTERNAL_IP
    ```
    
    <Important>
      **Switch to the ubuntu user after connecting:**
      ```bash
      sudo su - ubuntu
      ```
      This is a critical step! The rest of this guide assumes you're using the `ubuntu` user, and the paths and configurations are set up accordingly.
    </Important>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update System and Install Essential Packages">
    ```bash
    # Update package lists and install essential tools in one command
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl wget git unzip jq nano
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installing Oxy CLI

Let's install Oxy directly on the VM:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Required Dependencies">
    ```bash
    # Install all necessary dependencies at once
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev pkg-config
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Oxy">
    Run the official Oxy installation script:
    
    ```bash
    bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.oxy.tech)
    ```
    
    This script will download and install the latest stable version of Oxy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Installation">
    Confirm that Oxy is installed correctly:
    
    ```bash
    oxy --version
    ```
    
    You should see the version information displayed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up Oxy Workspace

Let's use the built-in `oxy init` command to initialize a new workspace with all the necessary files and configuration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Navigate to Workspace Directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/oxy-workspace
    cd ~/oxy-workspace
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Oxy Project">
    ```bash
    oxy init
    ```
    
    This interactive command will:
    1. Create a `config.yml` file with your database and model configurations
    2. Set up sample project files
    3. Create necessary directories like `agents` and `workflows`
    
    Follow the prompts to configure:
    - Database settings (You can start with DuckDB for simplicity)
    - Model configuration (e.g., OpenAI with your API key)
    
    The initialization process will ask for your OpenAI API key and create all the necessary configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Alternative: Set Up Git and Clone Existing Project">
    <Note>
      If you already have an existing Oxy project in a Git repository, you should set up Git and clone your repository instead of using `oxy init`.
    </Note>
    
    First, make sure Git is properly configured:
    
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
    
    Then clone your existing repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-oxy-project.git ~/oxy-workspace
    cd ~/oxy-workspace
    ```
    
    This will give you your existing project configuration and agents, which is preferable to starting from scratch if you already have a working setup.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Data Directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/oxy-data
    ```
    
    This directory will store all persistent data for Oxy, including the SQLite database files.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Create a standard `.env` file in the workspace directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/oxy-workspace
    nano .env
    ```
    
    Add your environment variables:
    
    ```bash
    OXY_STATE_DIR=/home/$(whoami)/oxy-data
    ```
    
    Save and exit.
    
    <Note>
      If you don't set `OXY_STATE_DIR`, Oxy will use the default location `~/.local/share/oxy/`. 
      We recommend setting it explicitly for production deployments to make backups and maintenance easier.
    </Note>
    
    Note: You won't need to manually set the OpenAI API key in the environment as it's already configured during the `oxy init` process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Firewall Configuration

To ensure your Oxy deployment is accessible, you need to create a firewall rule that allows traffic on port 3000:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Firewall Rule">
    In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **VPC network** > **Firewall**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Rule for Port 3000">
    Click **CREATE FIREWALL RULE** and configure:
    
    - **Name**: `allow-oxy-port-3000`
    - **Direction**: Ingress
    - **Action**: Allow
    - **Targets**: Specified target tags
    - **Target tags**: `oxy-server` (or the tag you want to use)
    - **Source IP ranges**: `0.0.0.0/0` (for public access) or your specific IP range for restricted access
    - **Protocols and ports**: 
      - Check "Specified protocols and ports"
      - Select "TCP"
      - Enter port `3000`
    
    Click **CREATE** to save the rule.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Tag to Your VM">
    Go back to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances**, select your VM instance, and click **EDIT**.
    
    In the **Network tags** field, add `oxy-server` (or whatever tag you used in the firewall rule).
    
    Click **SAVE**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Opening port 3000 to 0.0.0.0/0 allows public access to your Oxy instance. For production deployments, consider restricting access to specific IP ranges or implementing additional authentication measures.
</Warning>

## Setting Up and Starting Oxy as a Service

Let's configure Oxy to run automatically on system startup and restart if it fails:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Systemd Service File">
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/oxy.service
    ```
    
    Add the following content:
    
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Oxy Server
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=ubuntu
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/oxy-workspace
    EnvironmentFile=/home/ubuntu/oxy-workspace/.env
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/oxy serve --port 3000
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    
    <Note>
      We specify port 3000 explicitly to match the firewall rule configuration. The service will be accessible directly on this port from the internet.
    </Note>
    
    This configuration uses the default `ubuntu` user which is standard on GCP instances. If you're using a different username, adjust accordingly.
    
    Save and exit.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable and Start the Service">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable oxy
    sudo systemctl start oxy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Service">
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status oxy
    ```
    
    You should see that the service is active and running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Logs (if needed)">
    If you encounter any issues, check the logs:
    
    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u oxy -f
    ```
    
    This command will show you the live logs from the Oxy service.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Connection">
    You can test if Oxy is responding properly:
    
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000
    ```
    
    You should get a positive response indicating that Oxy is running.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Deployment">
    You can now access your Oxy deployment using:
    
    If you've configured a domain name:
    ```
    http://yourdomain.com:3000
    ```
    
    Or directly using your VM's external IP:
    ```
    http://YOUR_VM_EXTERNAL_IP:3000
    ```

    <Tip>
      For production deployments with HTTPS, consider setting up a reverse proxy like nginx with Let's Encrypt certificates, or implementing additional GCP services for SSL termination and enhanced security.
    </Tip>
    
    You should see the Oxy interface. Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully deployed Oxy on Google Cloud Platform.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Optional Configuration and Management

Everything up to this point completes the core setup of your Oxy deployment. The following sections cover additional aspects of managing your deployment that you may want to explore as needed.

## Data Persistence

It's important to understand how Oxy handles data persistence:

- Oxy uses SQLite for its internal database by default
- All data is stored in the directory specified by `OXY_STATE_DIR` environment variable (we set it to ~/oxy-data)
- If `OXY_STATE_DIR` is not set, Oxy uses `~/.local/share/oxy/` by default
- This directory contains database files, semantic information, cached query results, and workflow history

<Note>
  For production deployments, consider backing up the oxy-data directory regularly. You can set up automated backups to Google Cloud Storage using gsutil or use a persistent disk for enhanced reliability.
</Note>

## Managing Your Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stopping the Service">
    If you need to stop the Oxy service temporarily:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop oxy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Updating Oxy">
    To update Oxy to the latest version:
    
    ```bash
    # Stop the service first
    sudo systemctl stop oxy
    
    # Run the installation script again
    bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get.oxy.tech)
    
    # Start the service again
    sudo systemctl start oxy
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup Data">
    ```bash
    # Create a backup of your Oxy data
    tar -czf oxy-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/oxy-data/
    
    # Optional: Upload to Google Cloud Storage
    gsutil cp oxy-backup-*.tar.gz gs://your-bucket-name/
    ```
    
    You'll need the `gcloud` CLI installed and authenticated for the last command.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Machine Recommendations

<Note>
  Oxy runs well with just 4GB of memory for most use cases.
</Note>

Choose from these recommended instance types:

| Usage Level | ARM-based (Best Value) | x86-based |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Small (1-3 users) | `t2a-standard-1` (2 vCPU, 4 GB) | `e2-medium` (1 vCPU, 4 GB) |
| Medium (3-5 users) | `t2a-standard-2` (2 vCPU, 8 GB) | `e2-standard-2` (2 vCPU, 8 GB) |
| Large (5-15 users) | `t2a-standard-4` (4 vCPU, 16 GB) | `e2-standard-4` (4 vCPU, 16 GB) |

ARM-based instances (T2A series) typically offer 15-20% cost savings over equivalent x86 instances.

## Scaling on GCP

As your usage grows, you may need to scale your deployment:

### Vertical Scaling

1. Stop your VM from the GCP Console
2. Edit the VM configuration to increase CPU and memory
3. Start the VM again
4. Reconnect and start your Oxy service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start oxy
   ```

### Storage Scaling

If you need more storage for your Oxy data:

1. Create a new persistent disk in the GCP Console
2. Connect to your VM and mount the disk:
   ```bash
   # Mount the disk to a new location
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/oxy-data
   sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/disk/by-id/google-[DISK_NAME] /mnt/oxy-data
   sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /mnt/oxy-data
   
   # Copy your existing data to the new location
   cp -r ~/oxy-data/* /mnt/oxy-data/
   
   # Update the data path in your .env file
   echo "OXY_STATE_DIR=/mnt/oxy-data" > ~/oxy-workspace/.env
   
   # Restart Oxy to use the new location
   sudo systemctl restart oxy
   ```

3. To make the mount persistent across reboots, add it to fstab:
   ```bash
   echo "/dev/disk/by-id/google-[DISK_NAME] /mnt/oxy-data ext4 discard,defaults 0 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot access Oxy through the domain or IP">
    - Check your GCP firewall rules: Go to VPC Network → Firewall in GCP Console and verify port 3000 is allowed
    - Verify VM network tags match the firewall rule target tags
    - Test local connection: `curl http://localhost:3000`
    - For domain issues: Run `dig yourdomain.com` to verify DNS is pointing to your VM's external IP
    - Check if your VM's external IP has changed (this can happen after stop/start)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Oxy service won't start">
    - View detailed logs: `sudo journalctl -u oxy -f`
    - Verify environment file exists: `cat ~/oxy-workspace/.env`
    - Check service file: `sudo cat /etc/systemd/system/oxy.service`
    - Ensure workspace exists: `ls -la ~/oxy-workspace`
    - Verify Oxy binary is installed: `which oxy`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data not persisting between restarts">
    - Verify data directory exists: `ls -la ~/oxy-data`
    - Check environment variable is set: `grep OXY_STATE_DIR ~/oxy-workspace/.env`
    - If you didn't set `OXY_STATE_DIR`, check the default location: `ls -la ~/.local/share/oxy/`
    - Ensure proper permissions: `sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu ~/oxy-data`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Connection refused or timeout errors">
    - Verify the VM instance is running in the GCP Console
    - Check if the firewall rule allows traffic on port 3000
    - Ensure Oxy service is running: `sudo systemctl status oxy`
    - Test if the port is open: `sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :3000`
    - Verify the VM has the correct network tag applied
  </Accordion>

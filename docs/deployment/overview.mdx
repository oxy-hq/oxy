This guide walks you through deploying Oxy on a cloud environment, from provisioning infrastructure to configuring authentication.

<Tip>
  **Quick Start with Docker:** If you prefer a faster deployment option, you can use our [Docker deployment](/deployment/docker) method instead of the traditional setup. Docker provides a more streamlined experience with fewer manual steps.
</Tip>

## Deployment Paths

There are several approaches to deploying Oxy:

1. **Traditional Linux Setup** - Follow the step-by-step guide below to provision a machine, install dependencies, and configure each component manually.
2. **Docker Deployment** - Use our [Docker image](https://github.com/oxy-hq/oxy/pkgs/container/oxy) for a containerized deployment that simplifies setup and maintenance. See the [Docker deployment guide](/deployment/docker) for details.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment** - Deploy Oxy on Kubernetes clusters using our official Helm chart or raw YAML manifests. Choose from:
   - **[Helm Chart](/deployment/kubernetes-helm)** - Recommended for most Kubernetes deployments with sensible defaults and easy configuration
   - **[Raw YAML](/deployment/kubernetes-raw)** - For advanced users who need full control over Kubernetes resources
4. **Hands-on Guides** - For practical, ready-to-use deployment recipes, check our [hands-on guides](/deployment/hands-on) section which includes:
   - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** - Deploy Oxy on Google Cloud using our dedicated [GCP deployment guide](/deployment/gcp).

## Data Persistence

When deploying Oxy in production, it's important to understand how data is stored and persisted:

- Oxy uses SQLite by default for its internal state management
- Data is stored at the location specified by `OXY_STATE_DIR` environment variable
- If `OXY_STATE_DIR` is not set, data defaults to `~/.local/share/oxy/`
- This directory contains database files, semantic information, cached query results, and workflow history

### Persistence Strategies

For production deployments, ensure your data persistence strategy matches your reliability requirements:

- **Docker deployments**: Mount a volume to `/data` and set `OXY_STATE_DIR=/data`
- **Cloud VMs**: Use attached persistent disks (EBS volumes, Google Persistent Disks, etc.)
- **Self-hosted**: Consider regular backups of the state directory

<Warning>
  Data loss can occur if proper persistence is not configured. Always ensure your Oxy state directory is backed by reliable storage and included in your backup strategy.
</Warning>

## Quick One-Time Script

If you prefer to set up everything with a single script, you can use the following bash script that automates the entire deployment process. Customize the variables at the beginning to fit your requirements:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Oxy Cloud Deployment Script

# ===== CONFIGURATION =====
# Change these variables to match your setup
DOMAIN_NAME="your-domain.com"
WORKSPACE_DIR="/home/ubuntu/oxy-workspace"

<Warning>
  This script is provided as a starting point and may need adjustments for your specific environment. Always review scripts before running them on your server.o "Your Oxy instance should now be available at: https://$\{DOMAIN_NAME\}"

</Warning>

To use the script:
1. Save it to a file (e.g., `deploy-oxy.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x deploy-oxy.sh`  This script is provided as a starting point and may need adjustments for your specific environment. Always review scripts before running them on your server.
3. Edit the configuration variables at the beginning of the script
4. Run the script: `./deploy-oxy.sh`

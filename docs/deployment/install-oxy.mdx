# Install Oxy CLI

After setting up your server, the next step is to install and configure the Oxy CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Oxy">
    Follow the [Oxy installation instructions](../../README.md#installation) to install the Oxy CLI on your server.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Stable Release">
        ```bash
        bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://get.oxy.tech)
        ```

        This command downloads and installs the latest stable release of Oxy.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Edge Build">
        ```bash
        bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://nightly.oxy.tech)
        ```

        This installs the latest edge build from the main branch, which includes the newest features and fixes.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Nightly Build">
        ```bash
        OXY_CHANNEL=nightly bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://nightly.oxy.tech)
        ```

        This installs the latest nightly build (scheduled daily builds).
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Specific Version">
        ```bash
        # Specific stable version
        OXY_VERSION="0.1.0" bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://get.oxy.tech)

        # Specific edge build
        OXY_VERSION=edge-7cbf0a5 bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://nightly.oxy.tech)

        # Specific nightly build
        OXY_VERSION=nightly-20251204-abc1234 bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://nightly.oxy.tech)
        ```

        Install a specific version by setting the `OXY_VERSION` environment variable.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Info>
      **Edge vs Nightly:** Edge builds are created on every push to main, while nightly builds are scheduled daily. Both are pre-release versions for testing the latest features. Browse all available builds at [oxy-hq/oxy-nightly](https://github.com/oxy-hq/oxy-nightly/releases).
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    After installation, verify that Oxy is correctly installed:

    ```bash
    oxy --version
    ```

    This should display the current version of Oxy installed on your system.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Oxy as a System Service">
    To ensure Oxy runs automatically and persists across server restarts, set it up as a systemd service:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/oxy.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Oxy server
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=ubuntu
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/your-oxy-project
    ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/usr/local/bin/oxy serve & /usr/local/bin/oxy mcp-sse"
    Restart=always
    Environment="OXY_STATE_DIR=/home/ubuntu/oxy_data"

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    ```

    <Tip>
      Make sure to replace `/home/ubuntu/your-oxy-project` with the actual path to your Oxy workspace that you'll set up in a later step.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable and Start the Service">
    Enable the service to start automatically on boot and start it:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable oxy
    sudo systemctl start oxy
    ```

    You can check the status of the service with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status oxy
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Now that the Oxy CLI is installed and configured to run as a service, you can proceed to set up a reverse proxy for secure access.

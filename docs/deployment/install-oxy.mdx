# Install Oxy CLI

After setting up your server, the next step is to install and configure the Oxy CLI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Oxy">
    Follow the [Oxy installation instructions](../../README.md#installation) to install the Oxy CLI on your server.

    ```bash
    bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://get.oxy.tech)
    ```

    This command downloads and runs the official Oxy installation script.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    After installation, verify that Oxy is correctly installed:

    ```bash
    oxy --version
    ```

    This should display the current version of Oxy installed on your system.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Oxy as a System Service">
    To ensure Oxy runs automatically and persists across server restarts, set it up as a systemd service:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/oxy.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Oxy server
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=ubuntu
    WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/your-oxy-project
    ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/usr/local/bin/oxy serve & /usr/local/bin/oxy mcp-sse"
    Restart=always
    Environment="OXY_STATE_DIR=/home/ubuntu/oxy_data"

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    ```

    <Tip>
      Make sure to replace `/home/ubuntu/your-oxy-project` with the actual path to your Oxy workspace that you'll set up in a later step.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable and Start the Service">
    Enable the service to start automatically on boot and start it:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable oxy
    sudo systemctl start oxy
    ```

    You can check the status of the service with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status oxy
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now that the Oxy CLI is installed and configured to run as a service, you can proceed to set up a reverse proxy for secure access.

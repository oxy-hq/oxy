This guide explains how to deploy Oxy using Docker containers, providing an alternative to the traditional server-based deployment approach.

<Note>
  Using Docker simplifies the deployment process and environment setup, making
  it easier to run Oxy in a consistent environment across different platforms.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- Docker installed on your host system
- An Oxy workspace with your configuration files, agents, and workflows
- Required API keys and environment variables for your deployment

<Tip>
  We recommend your Docker host machine have a minimum of 4GB RAM for optimal
  performance of Oxy and related services.
</Tip>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with Oxy on Docker is to use the pre-built image from GitHub Packages:

```bash
# Pull the latest Oxy Docker image
docker pull ghcr.io/oxy-hq/oxy:0.2.3

# Run Oxy with a mounted workspace
docker run -d \
  --name oxy-instance \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/your/workspace:/app \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  -e OXY_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/oxy/data \
  ghcr.io/oxy-hq/oxy:0.2.3
```

## Why Use Docker Compose?

Docker Compose lets you define and manage multi-container applications with a single YAML file. For Oxy, Compose makes it easy to:

- Start Oxy and related services (like databases or proxies) with one command
- Configure environment variables, volumes, and ports in one place
- Ensure all containers are networked and started in the right order
- Reproduce your deployment setup easily across machines or teams

**In short:** Docker Compose simplifies running Oxy in production or development, especially when you need more than one container.

## Detailed Deployment Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Workspace">
    Before deploying, ensure you have an Oxy workspace ready with your configuration files. Your workspace directory should typically include:

    - `config.yml` - Main configuration file
    - Your agent definitions (`.agent.yml` files)
    - Your workflow definitions (`.workflow.yml` files)
    - Any other resources your agents and workflows need

    ```bash
    # Example workspace structure
    workspace/
    ├── config.yml
    ├── my-agent.agent.yml
    ├── my-workflow.workflow.yml
    └── resources/
        └── data.json
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Docker Compose File">
    For easier management, create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      oxy:
        image: ghcr.io/oxy-hq/oxy:0.2.3
        container_name: oxy-instance
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        working_dir: /workspace
        volumes:
          - ./workspace:/workspace
          - ./oxy-data:/var/lib/oxy/data
        environment:
          - OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
          - OXY_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/oxy/data
        restart: unless-stopped
        command: ["oxy", "serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "3000"]
    ```

    <Warning>
      Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key. For production deployments, consider using Docker secrets or environment files to avoid storing sensitive data in your compose file.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Container">
    Launch your Oxy container:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    By default, the container's working directory is `/app`. If you want to use `/workspace` as your working directory (as in the example above), make sure to set `working_dir: /workspace` in your Docker Compose file and mount your workspace to `/workspace`.

    Your Oxy instance will be available at `http://localhost:3000` once the container starts.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Volume Mounting Explained

When running Oxy in Docker, you'll typically need to mount two types of directories:

1. **Workspace Mount**: Maps your local Oxy workspace to the container

   ```
   -v /path/to/your/workspace:/workspace
   ```

   This allows Oxy to access your configuration, agents, and workflows.

2. **Data Mount**: Provides persistent storage for Oxy's state

   ```
   -v /path/to/persistent/data:/var/lib/oxy/data
   ```

   This ensures your data is preserved even if the container is restarted.

## Data Persistence

Oxy uses PostgreSQL for data storage, which means proper database configuration is essential for maintaining your data across container restarts or updates.

### Storage Location

- Oxy connects to PostgreSQL using the `OXY_DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- For development: Use `oxy start` to automatically set up PostgreSQL in Docker
- For production: Connect to an external PostgreSQL instance (AWS RDS, Supabase, etc.)

### What Data Is Stored

Oxy stores several types of data in PostgreSQL:

- Application state and metadata
- User information and authentication data
- Semantic information from synchronized databases
- Cached query results and intermediate data
- Workflow execution history and checkpoints

### Example Docker Setup with PostgreSQL

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:18-alpine
    container_name: oxy-postgres
    ports:
      - "15432:5432"
    volumes:
      # PostgreSQL 18+ uses /var/lib/postgresql (not /var/lib/postgresql/data)
      - oxy-postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=oxy
      # PostgreSQL 18+ requires PGDATA in a version-specific subdirectory
      - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker
    restart: unless-stopped

  oxy:
    image: ghcr.io/oxy-hq/oxy:0.2.3
    container_name: oxy-instance
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    working_dir: /workspace
    volumes:
      - ./workspace:/workspace
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
      - OXY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/oxy
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: ["oxy", "serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "3000"]

volumes:
  oxy-postgres-data:
```

<Tip>
  Alternatively, use `oxy start` which automatically manages PostgreSQL in
  Docker. See the [oxy start reference](/reference/oxy-start) for details.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  For production deployments, consider using managed PostgreSQL services: -
  Amazon RDS (AWS) - Cloud SQL (Google Cloud) - Azure Database for PostgreSQL -
  Supabase, DigitalOcean, or other managed providers
</Warning>

<Note>
  When using Docker Compose, your database data persists in the
  `oxy-postgres-data` volume. Use `docker-compose down -v` with caution as it
  will delete all data.
</Note>

## Environment Variables

Common environment variables to configure in your Oxy container:

| Variable         | Description                         | Example             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key                 | `sk-...`            |
| `OXY_STATE_DIR`  | Directory for Oxy state persistence | `/var/lib/oxy/data` |
| `DATABASE_URL`   | Connection URL if using a database  | `postgres://...`    |
| `PORT`           | Override the default port           | `8080`              |

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Docker Images

If you need to extend the official Oxy image with additional dependencies or configuration, you can create your own Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/oxy-hq/oxy:0.2.3

# Add custom dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y your-package

# Add custom files
COPY ./custom-config.yml /default-config.yml

# Override the default command if needed
CMD ["oxy", "serve", "--config", "/default-config.yml"]
```

### Health Checks

Add health checks to ensure your container is running properly:

```yaml
services:
  oxy:
    # ...existing configuration...
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

## Next Steps

Once your Docker deployment is up and running, you can:

- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automatically update your Oxy instance
- Implement monitoring and logging solutions
- Configure backups for your persistent data
- Scale horizontally for higher availability

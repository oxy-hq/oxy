### Language dependencies

Need to install Python and rust. (You can find instructions [here](../quickstart)). Right now, Python is not being used, but the `build.rs` file and the `make build` command set up scaffolding if you want to incorporate Python. In general, we will follow the principle that everything should be in rust where possible for `onyx-core`. But this is obviously not possible for a number of integrations and data-specific tasks.

### Build

Run `make build` to build.
So long as the python code doesn't change, `make build` only needs to be run once, and then we can just run `cargo build` to update the CLI.

The build sequencing is as follows:

- The python modules are installed using `poetry` to a virtual environment.
- The rust crate is built, and uses `pyo3` to execute the code _using the virtual environment that was made in the previous step_.

### Repository structure

This repository is a mixed Python/rust repository.

- ./onyx contains python code
- ./src contains rust code
  The CLI tool is built in Rust, and executes code from the Python backend code with `pyo3`. The choice of rust for the CLI tool came primarily to optimize for user experience and technical defensibility, as opposed to optimizing for leveraging community contributions for development. See the decision doc [here](https://www.notion.so/hyperquery/Why-Rust-for-CLI-front-end-10c13791d2b580f2afe2c9b2d2c663ea) for full context.

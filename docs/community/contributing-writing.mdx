We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) to power our documentation. You can contribute to our documentation by following the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine (If you don't have git on your machine, install it from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git))
- SSH key added to your GitHub account (If you don't have an SSH key, generate one from [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent))
- Access to the [onyx repository](https://github.com/onyx-hq/onyx)

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up repository">

    {/* TODO: When forking is enabled, update this doc to reflect this change */}

    <Note>
      Ignore this step if you have already cloned the repository.
    </Note>
    From the directory of your choice (e.g. `~/repos` or `~/projects`), git
    clone the onyx repository by running the following command on your terminal.

    ```sh terminal
    git clone git@github.com:onyx-hq/onyx.git
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up development environment">

    Install Mintlify CLI by running the following command on your terminal.

    <Info>
      This step is required to preview the changes you make to the
      documentation locally.
    </Info>

    ```sh terminal
    npm install -g @mintlify/cli
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update documentation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">

    Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):
    ```sh terminal
    cd onyx
    ```

    Then create and switch to a new branch using the following command:

    ```sh terminal
    git checkout -b <name>/<description>
    # Example: git checkout -b jinjae/add-redshift-integration
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make necessary changes">
    Now open the page you'd like to edit and make the necessary changes.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview changes locally">
    Save the changes you've made by pressing `Cmd + S` (Mac) or `Ctrl + S` (Windows).
    
    Change to the docs directory on your computer by running the following command:
    ```sh terminal
    cd docs/
    ```

    Then run the following command to preview changes locally:

    ```sh terminal
    mintlify dev
    ```

    <Note>
      This command must be run from the docs directory where the mint.json file exists. If not, you will get an error "Must be run in a directory where a mint.json file exists."
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add and commit changes">
    Once you are happy with the changes you've made, add and commit those changes.

    ```sh terminal
    git add .
    git commit -m "docs: improve bigquery page"
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Submit changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push changes to GitHub">
    Once you’re ready to publish changes, push your changes!
    
    If your local branch hasn’t been published to remote yet, publish your branch first.     
    To publish (push) a local branch to the remote repository for the first time, use:

    ```sh terminal
    git push -u origin "new-branch-name"
    # Example: git push -u origin jinjae/docs-improve-bigquery
    ```

    After this initial push, you can simply use:

    ```sh terminal
    git push
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit your changes for review">
    Finally, if you are happy with the changes you’ve made, create a pull request.

    You can create a PR by going to your branch on GitHub, and clicking on the `Contribute` button.

    Clicking on the `Contribute` button will open a dropdown menu with an option to create a pull request.

    Finally, add @jinjakim as the reviewer, and create the pull request.

# The fastest way to build data agents

**Onyx** is a lightweight, yaml-based data agent builder for the command line.

## What is a data agent?

Data agents are prompted LLMs that can reason around data. Data agents built in
onyx ingest semantic information (at present, in the form of plain SQL) and use
this to craft and execute SQL queries against a database (both cloud or
local).

**Onyx** consists of two principal elements to configure these data agents,
each tied to a specific directory within your Onyx project:

- `./agents`: Configuration files that define the agents *in plain yaml*. Each
agent is scoped to particular directories within the `data` directory.
- `./data`: A directory of SQL queries (which we generally suggest should be
organized into a directory structure that reflects the organization structure).

Data agents can be interfaced with directly using the `onyx ask <question>`
command, which will send the `<question>` to the prompted LLM, or composed into `workflows`.

## What is a workflow?

A workflow is a sequence of data agents that do specific tasks, defined in the
`./workflows` directory of your Onyx project. In the Onyx
nomenclature, each workflow is comprised of `steps`, each of which is an `{ask,
agent}` pair. A workflow is similar to a "chain" in the prompt engineering
parlance, but with a few key differences:

- **Workflows are DAGs.** Whereas chains can become arbitrarily complex with
arbitrarily nested loops, complex reply logic, and opaque branching structures,
workflows are DAGs, which enforce a clearer, more predictable flow from input
to output.
- **Workflows separate logic from execution.** Because workflows are written in
yaml, the DAG definition is entirely separate from the execution engine
(usually Python), while other Python-based systems keep these tightly coupled
and so ultimately become difficult to build and maintain.
- **Workflows are only executable, not interactive.** Workflows are designed to
be deterministic pipelines with data agents baked in as functional components,
not agentic interfaces for chat.

These choices generally reduce the flexibility of Onyx when compared to say,
`langchain` or `llama_index`, but they also dramatically reduce the complexity
of the system. You can think of Onyx's `workflow` paradigm as a domain-specific
chain-builder for data workflows, where most (if not all) tasks simply pass
results around between different agents.

## The fastest way to build data agents

**Onyx** is a lightweight, yaml-based data agent builder for the command line.

### What is a data agent?

A data agent is an LLM-based agent that can manipulate and synthesize data. **Onyx** is a tool that allows you to build these agents quickly and easily, with a focus on flexibility and ease of use.

Data agents built in onyx ingest semantic information and use this to either execute SQL queries against a database, retrieve from an in-process database, or retrieve from local sources (text, pdf, etc.)

**Onyx** consists of two principal elements to configure these data agents:

- agents: Configuration files that define the agents. Each agent is scoped to particular semantic models.
- data: A directory of SQL queries, organized in a directory structure that reflects the organization structure. Each SQL file should be placed in the sub-directory corresponding to the widest set of teams that it serves (company-wide metrics, for instance, should be placed in the base data/ directory).

### **Onyx** core vision

`onyx-core` as-is provides two components: an explorer (`onyx search`) and an LLM interface that few-shots these entities into an LLM chatbot prompt chain (`onyx ask`).

The longer-term vision of `onyx-core` is such that the explorer provides search through a knowledge graph defining relevant entities (e.g. queries, metrics, dimensions, but perhaps an even wider scope, ultimately).

# The fastest way to build data agents

**Onyx** is a lightweight, yaml-based data agent builder for the command line.

## What is a data agent?

Data agents are prompted LLMs that can reason around data. Data agents built in
onyx ingest semantic information (at present, in the form of plain SQL) and use
this to craft and execute SQL queries against a database (either cloud or
local).

**Onyx** consists of two principal elements to configure data agents, each tied
to a specific directory within your Onyx project:

- `./agents`: Configuration files that define the agents *in plain yaml*. Each
agent is scoped to particular directories within the `data` directory.
- `./data`: A directory of SQL queries (which we generally suggest should be
organized into a directory structure that reflects the organization structure).

Data agents can be interfaced with directly using the `onyx ask <question>`
command, which will send the `<question>` to the prompted LLM, or composed into `workflows`.

## What is a workflow?

A workflow is a sequence of data agents that do specific tasks, defined in the
`./workflows` directory of your Onyx project. In the Onyx
nomenclature, each workflow is comprised of `steps`, each of which is an `{ask,
agent}` pair. Read more in our [workflows](/learn-about-onyx/workflows) section.

# The framework for agentic analytics

**Onyx** is a lightweight, declarative framework for agentic analytics.

## What is agentic analytics?

Agentic analytics is a re-imagined analytics process that involves constructing
prompted LLM agents to help automate the more mundane aspects of the standard
analytics workflow. Traditional vendors tend to incorporate AI into analytics
systems through the introduction of unreliable bolt-on SQL auto-pilots, but
these often have insufficient context to be reliably used. The vision of
agentic analytics, instead, is one where analysts build and curate these agents
to ensure greater accuracy through robust semantic modeling, iterative testing
processes, and scoping these data agents to specific scopes.

Agentic analytics centers around three principal components:

1. Data agents
2. Workflows
3. Data

## What are data agents?

Data agents are prompted LLMs that can reason around data. Data agents built in
onyx ingest semantic information and use this to craft and execute SQL queries
against a database.

**Onyx** consists of two principal elements to configure data agents, each tied
to a specific directory within your Onyx project:

- `.agent.yml` files: These are configuration files that define the agents and
  their instructions _in plain yaml_. Read more in our
  [agents](/learn-about-onyx/agents) section.
- `.sql` and `.sem.yml` files: We provide two kinds of raw data files to allow
  for injection of semantic information into the prompts: SQL queries and
  semantic models (`.sem.yml` files). These can be directly injected into the
  prompts (generally preferred) or retrieved against to provide your agent with
  context it needs to write a query. Read more in our [semantic
  models](/learn-about-onyx/semantic-model) section.

Data agents can be interfaced with directly using the `onyx run
path/to/agent.agent.yml "<question>"` command, which will send the `<question>`
to the prompted LLM, or composed into `workflows`.

## What is a workflow?

A workflow is a chain of agents and tasks. They are identified as workflow
files by the onyx runtime through the extension `.workflow.yml`. In the Onyx
nomenclature, each workflow is comprised of `tasks`. Read more in our
[workflows](/learn-about-onyx/workflows) section.

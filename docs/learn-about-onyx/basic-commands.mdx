### Agent interaction

Once you have your agents, config, and data configured, you can ask this agent questions by running `onyx ask <prompt>` from within the root of your `onyx` project directory, as shown below:

```bash
onyx ask "How many users do we have?"  # Ask a question of the default agent
```

If you want to access a specific agent (for either `search` or `ask`), you can do so by specifying the agent name (removing the `.yml` extension) as an argument.

```bash
onyx ask --agent=default "How many users do we have?"  # Ask a question of the specific agent `default.yaml`
```

### Run queries

Run a raw query on target warehouse

```bash
onyx run primary_warehouse example_monthly_rejected.sql
```

Run a query rendered from a Jinja template

```bash
onyx run primary_warehouse example_weekly_rejected.sql -v -v variable_a=1 variable_b=a variable_c=\*
```

### Workflow usage

To execute a workflow, you can run:

```bash
onyx execute workflow_name  # Replace workflow_name with workflow name without the `.yml` extension
```

### Frontend client

If you'd like to run a local instance of a web-client, you can run `onyx
serve`, which will stand up a lightweight API server and web application.

### Embedding management

To embed files from `<project_root>/data/**` into vector store you can use `onyx build`. We're downloading model from huggingface hub so you may need to login using:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

or simply copy your plaintext token into `$HOME/.cache/huggingface/token` file. And then run build to index the data.

```bash
onyx build
```

Then verify using

```bash
onyx vec-search "Hello Embedding"
```

### Core elements

There are three core elements in Onyx:

- [agents](/learn-about-onyx/agents): prompted LLM chatbots that can reason around data (`.agent.yml` files).
- [workflows](/learn-about-onyx/workflows): DAGs of agents and tasks (`.workflow.yml` files).
- [data](/learn-about-onyx/data): additional source material that your agents have access to.
  - [semantic models](/learn-about-onyx/semantic-model): a specific type of source material that encodes and structures semantic information (`.sem.yml` files).

Beyond this, there is a single configuration file that you need to set up,
which will define the models, warehouses, and retrieval algorithms that the
agents will have access to.

- [./config.yml](/learn-about-onyx/config): onyx project configuration file

### Core elements

There are three core elements in Onyx:

- [agents](/learn-about-onyx/agents): prompted LLM chatbots that can reason around data
- [data](/learn-about-onyx/data): raw semantic source material that your agents have access to
- [**workflows**](/learn-about-onyx/workflows): DAGs of agents

Beyond this, there is a single global configuration file that you need to set
up, which will define the models, warehouses, and retrieval algorithms that the
agents will have access to.

- [**~/.config/onyx/config.yml**](/learn-about-onyx/config): global configuration file

These fit into the following structure:

```bash onyx_starter_project
onyx_starter_project/
|--- agents/
|    |--- default.yml
|--- data/
|    |--- sample_query.sql
|--- workflows/
|    |--- sample_workflow.yml
|--- README.md

~/.config/onyx/
|--- config.yml
```

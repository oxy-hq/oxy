title: "Data"
description: "Raw semantic source material that your agents have access to"
---

The `data/` directory stores semantic information that agents can access by
specifying the `data` parameter within the agent config. Any set of
subdirectories within `data` can be provided therein, giving the agent access
to any SQL folders within the given paths (and that directory only -- we do not
recurse through any nested directories).

### Structuring semantic information

Each sub-directory should be populated with SQL queries with the `.sql`
extension -- these SQL queries will be fed to the LLM as examples of queries to
generate. For the time being, only SQL queries are accepted, but in the future,
we will provide the ability to fill each directory with a wider range of
semantic entities and formulas.

At the top of these files, you should generally add a comment that describes
what the query does (we call this "front matter" internally). While we
currently only support all-shot retrieval (pulling in all queries in a
directory), in the future, this front matter will be used for retrieval.

<Warning>
  The accepted format of this front matter will likely change in the future.
</Warning>

```sql
/*
 * The following query gets the date range over which the data is available.
 */

select
  min(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m', month)) as min_date,
  max(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m', month)) as max_date 
from 'user_events.csv';
```


### Best practices

We suggest organizing the `data/` directory in a way that reflects your org
structure. Place queries in directories based on the broadest user group that
might use said query - for example, company-wide queries go in the root `data/`
directory, while team-specific queries belong in their respective team
subdirectories.

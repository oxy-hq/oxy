description: How to write tests
---

Tests are a core part of onyx. Tests can be written either as a part of
`agents` or `workflows`.

At present, we support a single type of test, `eval_type: consistency`, which
measures the consistency between two results. Within agents, this can be
implemented as follows:

```yaml
tests:
  - eval_type: consistency
    n: 5  # number of runs to test
    task_description: "how many users do we have?"
```

The `task_description` field is the question that you want to test the LLM's
performance on (note: we don't call this `prompt` because we are nesting this
`task_description` within a separate prompt that runs the evaluation, so
`prompt` in this situation would be ambiguous). `n` indicates the number of
times to run the agent to produce a response to the `task_description` request.
 
For workflows, `task_description` is not required, but instead a `task_ref`
value should be provided, as shown below:

```yaml
tests:
  - eval_type: consistency
    task_ref: task_name
    n: 5  # number of runs to test
```

The `task_ref` field indicates the `task` name that is to be tested. No
`task_description` is required because the given `prompt` will be used for
evaluation.

These tests can be run by running either, for an agent:

```sh
onyx test agent-name.agent.yml
```

Or, for a workflow:

```sh
onyx test workflow-name.workflow.yml
```

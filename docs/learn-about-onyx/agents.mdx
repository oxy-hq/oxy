An agent is an LLM-based agent that can manipulate and synthesize data.
Configuration files that define the agents. Each agent is scoped to particular semantic models.

- Configure agents in a YAML file.
- Organize them under the `agents` folder.

### Sample config

````yaml agents/default.yml
model: "openai-4o"
warehouse: "primary_warehouse"
scope: "."
retrieval_type: "all-shot"
retrieval: "default"
system_instructions: |
  You are an Data Analyst expert. Your task is to help the user understand the provided SQL query and Result.
  DO NOT print the SQL query and Result because it already printed out to the user.
  ALWAYS execute the SQL query without confirmation.
  You have access to the following warehouses:

  Name: {{ warehouse.name }}
  Dialect: {{ warehouse.type }}
  Tables:
  ```
  {% for table in warehouse.tables %}{{ table }}

  {% endfor %}
  ```

  Queries:
  ```
  {% for query in queries %}
  {{ query }}
  {% endfor %}
  ```

sql_tool_instructions: |
The `sql` should be returned in plain text, not in JSON.
The `sql` should conform to the dialect of the warehouse.

You need to use the following warehouse:
Name: {{ warehouse.name }}
Dialect: {{ warehouse.type }}

tools:
- "query"
- "visualize"

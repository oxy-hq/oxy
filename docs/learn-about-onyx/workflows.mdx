A workflow is a series of tasks (`tasks`) executed sequentially. Each `task`
can be either a deterministic command (such as `execute_sql`, in which a named
sql query is executed) or an agent given a prompt. These tasks are composed by
passing results from one agent to the input of another -- the output of each
task can be accessed with Jinja as `{{ name_of_task }}`.

## Workflow components

Workflows are DAGs comprised of `tasks`. Each task has a few common properties:

| Component | Description                                                                  | Type     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| name      | Identifier for the task. Output of the task can be referenced as `{{name}}`. | required |
| type      | The tool to use for this task. See the following section for possible types. | required |

Specific task types have additional property requirements.

### `type: agent`

| Component | Description                                                                       | Type                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| agent_ref | The agent to use within the `agents` directory, referenced by the agent's `name`. | required for `type: agent` |
| prompt    | The input prompt passed to the agent for this task.                               | required for `type: agent` |

### `type: execute_sql`

Executes a SQL query referenced by filename.

| Component | Description                                              | Type     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| sql_file  | The sql file within the `data` directory to execute      | required |
| database  | The name of the `database` to execute the query against  | required |

### `type: formatter`

Formats the provided `template` using the outputs of other `tasks`, then passes
the rendered template as output.

| Component | Description                                       | Type     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| template  | The template to be rendered and passed as output. | required |

### `type: loop_sequential`

| Component | Description                                                                 | Type     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| values    | Values to iterate over for each `task` in the current task's `tasks` array. | required |
| tasks     | Defines the tasks to execute for each `value`.                              | required |

`values` are accessed within the `tasks` of the `loop_sequential` task as
`<name>.value`, where `<name>` is the name of the task. A sample partial config
is shown below:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: loop_through_animals
    type: loop_sequential
    values: ["whale", "dolphin", "shark"]
    tasks:
      - name: get_number_of_animals
        type: agent
        agent_ref: default
        prompt: |
          Get the number of {{ loop_through_animals.value }}s in the ocean.
```

This is often combined with the `type: formatter` task, which can loop through
the resulting outputs and form them into a single string. The output from a
`loop_sequential` is an array of dictionaries for each `value`, where the keys
for each element of each dictionary is named according to the `task`'s' `name`
field. These can be accessed by using Jinja, by looping through the `{{
<loop_name> }}` variable (`{{ loop_through_animals }}` above).

An example of this behavior is shown below:

```yaml
- name: format_animal_report
  type: formatter
  template: |
    {% for animal in loop_through_animals %}
    {{ animal.get_number_of_animals }}
    {% endfor %}
```

## Examples

```yaml workflows/monthly_report.yml
tasks:
  - name: raw_sql_calculation
    type: execute_sql
    sql_file: month_over_month_overall_performance.sql # A sql file to execute deterministically
  - name: month_over_month_metrics # An identifier for the task. Results can be referenced by jinja-wrapping this name
    type: agent
    agent_ref: default # The agent .yml file to use for this task
    prompt: Calculate month-over-month performance of views and clicks for the entire ad portfolio. # The prompt given to the agent
  - name: monthly_report
    type: agent
    agent_ref: local
    prompt: |
      Create a report using the provided data that looks as follows:
      The overall portfolio brought in X views and Y clicks in MM/YYYY, up A% and B%, respectively.
      {{month_over_month_metrics}}
```

## Workflows vs. chains

A workflow is similar to a "chain" in the prompt engineering parlance, but with
a few key differences:

- **Workflows are DAGs.** Whereas chains can become arbitrarily complex with
  arbitrarily nested loops, complex reply logic, and opaque branching structures,
  workflows are DAGs, which enforce a clearer, more predictable flow from input
  to output.
- **Workflows separate logic from execution.** Because workflows are written in
  yaml, the DAG definition is entirely separate from the execution engine
  (usually Python), while other Python-based systems keep these tightly coupled
  and so ultimately become difficult to build and maintain.

These choices generally reduce the flexibility of Onyx when compared to say,
`langchain` or `llama_index`, but they also dramatically reduce the complexity
of the system. You can think of Onyx's `workflow` paradigm as a domain-specific
chain-builder for data workflows, where most (if not all) tasks simply pass
results around between different agents.

title: "Workflows"
description: How to define workflows
---

A workflow is a handful of agents with specific `prompt`s, composed by passing
results from one agent to the input of another. A workflow is similar to a
"chain" in the prompt engineering parlance, but with a few key differences:

- **Workflows are DAGs.** Whereas chains can become arbitrarily complex with
arbitrarily nested loops, complex reply logic, and opaque branching structures,
workflows are DAGs, which enforce a clearer, more predictable flow from input
to output.
- **Workflows separate logic from execution.** Because workflows are written in
yaml, the DAG definition is entirely separate from the execution engine
(usually Python), while other Python-based systems keep these tightly coupled
and so ultimately become difficult to build and maintain.
- **Workflows are only executable, not interactive.** Workflows are designed to
be deterministic pipelines with data agents baked in as functional components,
not agentic interfaces for chat.

These choices generally reduce the flexibility of Onyx when compared to say,
`langchain` or `llama_index`, but they also dramatically reduce the complexity
of the system. You can think of Onyx's `workflow` paradigm as a domain-specific
chain-builder for data workflows, where most (if not all) tasks simply pass
results around between different agents.

## Sample config

```yaml agents/monthly_report.yml
name: monthly_report

steps:
  - name: month_over_month_metrics  # An identifier for the step. Results can be referenced by jinja-wrapping this name
    agent_ref: default  # The agent .yml file to use for this step
    prompt: Calculate month-over-month performance of views and clicks for the entire ad portfolio.  # The prompt given to the agent
  - name: monthly_report
    agent_ref: local
    prompt: |
      Create a report using the provided data that looks as follows:
      The overall portfolio brought in X views and Y clicks in MM/YYYY, up A% and B%, respectively.
      {{month_over_month_metrics}}
```

A workflow is a series of tasks (`steps`) executed sequentially. Each `step`
can be either a deterministic command (such as `execute_sql`, in which a named
sql query is executed) or an agent given a prompt. These steps are composed by
passing results from one agent to the input of another -- the output of each
step can be accessed with Jinja as `{{ name_of_step }}`.

## Workflow components

Workflows are DAGs comprised of `steps`. Each step has a few common properties:

| Component | Description                                                                  | Type     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| name      | Identifier for the step. Output of the step can be referenced as `{{name}}`. | required |
| type      | The tool to use for this step. See the following section for possible types. | required |

Specific step types have additional property requirements.

### `type: agent`

| Component | Description                                                                       | Type                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| agent_ref | The agent to use within the `agents` directory, referenced by the agent's `name`. | required for `type: agent` |
| prompt    | The input prompt passed to the agent for this step.                               | required for `type: agent` |

### `type: execute_sql`

Executes a SQL query referenced by filename.

| Component | Description                                              | Type     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| sql_file  | The sql file within the `data` directory to execute      | required |
| warehouse | The name of the `warehouse` to execute the query against | required |

### `type: formatter`

Formats the provided `template` using the outputs of other `steps`, then passes
the rendered template as output.

| Component | Description                                       | Type     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| template  | The template to be rendered and passed as output. | required |

### `type: loop_sequential`

| Component | Description                                                                 | Type     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| values    | Values to iterate over for each `step` in the current step's `steps` array. | required |
| steps     | Defines the steps to execute for each `value`.                              | required |

`values` are accessed within the `steps` of the `loop_sequential` step as
`<name>.value`, where `<name>` is the name of the step. A sample partial config
is shown below:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: loop_through_animals
    type: loop_sequential
    values: ["whale", "dolphin", "shark"]
    steps:
      - name: get_number_of_animals
        type: agent
        agent_ref: default
        prompt: |
          Get the number of {{ loop_through_animals.value }}s in the ocean.
```

This is often combined with the `type: formatter` step, which can loop through
the resulting outputs and form them into a single string. The output from a
`loop_sequential` is an array of dictionaries for each `value`, where the keys
for each element of each dictionary is named according to the `step`'s' `name`
field. These can be accessed by using Jinja, by looping through the `{{
<loop_name> }}` variable (`{{ loop_through_animals }}` above).

An example of this behavior is shown below:

```yaml
- name: format_animal_report
  type: formatter
  template: |
    {% for animal in loop_through_animals %}
    {{ animal.get_number_of_animals }}
    {% endfor %}
```

## Examples

```yaml workflows/monthly_report.yml
steps:
  - name: raw_sql_calculation
    type: execute_sql
    sql_file: month_over_month_overall_performance.sql # A sql file to execute deterministically
  - name: month_over_month_metrics # An identifier for the step. Results can be referenced by jinja-wrapping this name
    type: agent
    agent_ref: default # The agent .yml file to use for this step
    prompt: Calculate month-over-month performance of views and clicks for the entire ad portfolio. # The prompt given to the agent
  - name: monthly_report
    type: agent
    agent_ref: local
    prompt: |
      Create a report using the provided data that looks as follows:
      The overall portfolio brought in X views and Y clicks in MM/YYYY, up A% and B%, respectively.
      {{month_over_month_metrics}}
```

## Workflows vs. chains

A workflow is
similar to a "chain" in the prompt engineering parlance, but with a few key
differences:

- **Workflows are DAGs.** Whereas chains can become arbitrarily complex with
  arbitrarily nested loops, complex reply logic, and opaque branching structures,
  workflows are DAGs, which enforce a clearer, more predictable flow from input
  to output.
- **Workflows separate logic from execution.** Because workflows are written in
  yaml, the DAG definition is entirely separate from the execution engine
  (usually Python), while other Python-based systems keep these tightly coupled
  and so ultimately become difficult to build and maintain.
- **Workflows are only executable, not interactive.** Workflows are designed to
  be deterministic pipelines with data agents baked in as functional components,
  not agentic interfaces for chat.

These choices generally reduce the flexibility of Onyx when compared to say,
`langchain` or `llama_index`, but they also dramatically reduce the complexity
of the system. You can think of Onyx's `workflow` paradigm as a domain-specific
chain-builder for data workflows, where most (if not all) tasks simply pass
results around between different agents.

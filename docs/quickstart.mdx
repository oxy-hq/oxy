### Overview

In thi

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install oxy">
    Upon successful installation, you should see the message "Oxy has been installed successfully."

    You may need to restart your terminal for the command to be recognized.

    <Info>
      For transparency, you can review the [installation script's source code](https://github.com/oxy-hq/oxy/blob/main/install_oxy.sh).
    </Info>
    <Accordion title="Verify Your Installation (Optional)">
      After the installation is complete, you may verify that it was successful by running:

      ```sh
      oxy --version
      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a sample repository">
    In order to get started with a base agent set up, run the following command in an empty directory where you want to store your project:

    ```sh
    oxy init
    ```

    This command will generate the main oxy configuration file (`config.yml`), a sample agent file, a sample workflow file, some data, and a sample semantic layer file.
    If you use all the configuration defaults, you should be able to run the agent and workflow against the sample data out-of-the-box.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect oxy to OpenAI">
    For the model, we recommend using OpenAI's gpt-4.1. For alternative models, please refer to our integration documentation, [here](/integrations/overview).

    Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### All Done

Congrats\! You're ready to start using Oxy now. If you haven't changed the configuration defaults, you should be able to run the following commands to test out oxy against some sample sleep data:

```bash
oxy run sql-generator.agent.yml "On how many nights did I get good sleep in the last year?"  # ask a question to the sample agent
oxy test sql-generator.agent.yml  # runs all defined tests against the sql-generator agent

oxy run report-generator.workflow.yml  # execute the sample workflow
oxy test report-generator.workflow.yml  # run all defined tests against the workflow

oxy serve  # stands up a GUI against your agents and workflows
```

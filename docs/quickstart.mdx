### Overview

In this quickstart guide, we will install onyx and bootstrap a simple setup
that uses DuckDB as warehouse and OpenAI as LLM provider. For this walkthrough,
you'll need an OpenAI API key and access to a terminal.

### Install and configure onyx

Onyx supports both Mac and Windows. To get started with onyx, you will need to
work within the terminal. For Mac users, we recommend using
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as it offers better features, customization
options, and more frequent updates as compared to the stock Mac terminal. Other
great terminal options include the GPU-accelerated
[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) or AI-native
[Warp](https://warp.dev/). For windows, we recommend installing WSL 2 (search
for`Ubuntu` in the Microsoft store).

Once you have your terminal set up, follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install onyx">
    Install onyx by running the following within your Mac/Linux/WSL terminal:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onyx-hq/onyx-public-releases/refs/heads/main/install_onyx.sh)
    ```

    Upon successful installation, you should see the message "Onyx has been installed successfully."

    <Info>
      For transparency, you can review the [installation script's source code](https://github.com/onyx-hq/onyx-public-releases/blob/main/install_onyx.sh).
    </Info>
    <Accordion title="Verify Your Installation (Optional)">

      After the installation is complete, you may verify that it was successful by running:
      ```sh
      onyx --version
      ```
      and a configuration file is created at `~/.config/onyx/config.yml` by running:
      ```sh
      cat ~/.config/onyx/config.yml
      # should output something
      ```
    </Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a sample repository">
    In order to get started with a base agent set up, run the following command in an empty directory where you want to store your project:
    ```sh
    onyx init
    ```
    This command will generate the main onyx configuration file (located at `~/.config/onyx/config.yml`) as well as a sample agent file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect onyx to OpenAI">
    For the model, we recommend using OpenAI's gpt-4o. For alternative models, please refer to our integration documentation, [here](/integrations/overview).

    Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### All Done

Congrats! You're ready to start using Onyx now.

  <Accordion title="Using the CLI (Recommended)">
    You can use the `run` subcommand to ask questions to your agents:

    ```sh
    onyx run path/to/sql-generator.agent.yml "Who is the most engaged customer?"
    ```

    and receive a response from your agents. There are other subcommands you can
    use to interact with your agents, and you can explore them by
    running:

    ```sh
    onyx --help
    ```

### Overview

In this quickstart guide, we will use BigQuery as our data warehouse and OpenAI as our LLM provider. It will show you how to:

- Install onyx
- Connect onyx to BigQuery
- Connect onyx to OpenAI
- Install onyx desktop app

### Prerequisites

- Access to onyx's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/onyx-hq/onyx)
- A Google Cloud account that has access to the BigQuery dataset you want to use
- An OpenAI API key

### Install and configure onyx

Onyx supports both Mac and Windows.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac">

    To get started with **onyx**, you will need to work within the terminal. We recommend using [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as it offers better features, customization options, and more frequent updates compared to the default terminal.

    Other great terminal options include the GPU-accelerated [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
    or AI-native [Warp](https://warp.dev/).

    <Warning>
      Please refrain from using the default macOS terminal. It receives updates less frequently than other terminal emulators, which may impact your development experience.
    </Warning>

    Once you have your terminal set up, follow the steps below:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install onyx">
        Install onyx by running:

        - For linux and macOS:

        ```bash
        bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onyx-hq/onyx-public-releases/refs/heads/main/install_onyx.sh)
        ```

`        For windows, we recommend installing WSL 2 (search for`Ubuntu` in the Microsoft store).

        Upon successful installation, you should see the message "Onyx has been installed successfully."
        <img class="rounded-md" src="/images/installation-success.jpeg" alt="installation successful" />

        <Info>
          For transparency, you can review the [installation script's source code](https://github.com/onyx-hq/onyx-public-releases/blob/main/install_onyx.sh).
        </Info>
        <Accordion title="Verify Your Installation (Optional)">

          After the installation is complete, you may verify that it was successful by running:
          ```sh
          onyx --version
          ```
          and a configuration file is created at `~/.config/onyx/config.yml` by running:
          ```sh
          cat ~/.config/onyx/config.yml
          # should output something
          ```
        </Accordion>

      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a sample repository">
        In order to configure agents and other query settings, you need to create a sample repository. You can do this by running:
        ```sh
        git clone git@github.com:onyx-hq/onyx-sample-repo.git
        cd onyx-sample-repo
        ```
        <Note>
          If you havenâ€™t set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
        </Note>

        Start by exploring the pre-configured agents, default and product-team, in the `agents` folder. When you're ready, customize `config.yml` to add your own agents, models, and warehouses.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure onyx">
        The main configuration file is located at `~/.config/onyx/config.yml`.
        You can access it by:
        - running `open ~/.config/onyx/config.yml` in your terminal. This will open the file in your default IDE (generally, Xcode).
        - or directly in your Finder
          <Tip>
            To show hidden files and directories, open Finder and press `Cmd + Shift + .`
          </Tip>
          <img class="rounded-md" src="/images/config-screenshot.jpeg" alt="config" />
        The `config.yml` file will look like this:
        ```yaml config.yml
        warehouses:
        - name: primary_warehouse
          type: bigquery
          key_path: /path/to/key #replace
          dataset: dbt_prod_core

        models:
          - name: openai-4o
            vendor: openai
            model_ref: gpt-4o
            key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY

        retrievals:
          - name: default
            embed_model: "bge-small-en-v1.5"
            rerank_model: "jina-reranker-v2-base-multiligual"
            top_k: 10
            factor: 5
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect onyx to BigQuery">

        You need to replace `/path/to/key` or `/path/to/warehouse` with the actual path to your BigQuery service key or the path to the directory where you want to store your data.
        Here is a working example with actual paths:

        ```yaml config.yml
        warehouses:
          - name: bigquery
            type: bigquery
            key_path: /Users/sampleuser/.config/onyx/project-dataset-XXXXXXXXXX.json
            dataset: dbt_prod_core
          - name: duckdbexample
            type: duckdb
            key_path: /Users/sampleuser/.config/onyx/project-dataset-XXXXXXXXXX.json
            dataset: "/Users/sampleuser/onyx/onyx-sample-repo/"

        models:
          - name: openai-4o
            vendor: openai
            key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
            model_ref: gpt-4o
          - name: openai-4o-mini
            vendor: openai
            key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
            model_ref: gpt-4o-mini
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect onyx to OpenAI">
        For the model, we recommend using OpenAI's gpt-4o. For alternative models, please refer to our integration documentation, [here](/integrations/overview).

        Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.
      </Step>

### All Done

Congrats! You're ready to start using Onyx now.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using the CLI (Recommended)">
    You can use the `run` subcommand to ask questions to your agents:

    ```sh
    onyx run path/to/agent.agent.yml "Who is the most engaged customer?"
    ```

    and receive a response from your agents. There are other subcommands you can
    use to interact with your agents, and you can explore them by
    running:

    ```sh
    onyx --help
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Install Onyx desktop app

The Onyx desktop app is a GUI that allows you to interact with your agents without using the CLI. <Info><DownloadLink /></Info>

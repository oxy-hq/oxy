<Info>
  These are instructions in the absence of a brew formula/cask. Some steps will
  eventually be subsumed within a single command, `brew install onyx/onyx`.
</Info>

To get started with **onyx**, you will need to work within the terminal. By default, you
have a terminal on your MacBook, which you can access through Spotlight. For a faster experience, you can download tried-and-true [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), GPU-accelerated [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty),
or AI-native [Warp](https://warp.dev/).

Once you have your terminal set up, copy and paste the commands below:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install onyx">
    Install onyx by running:
    ```sh
      curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onyx-hq/onyx-public-releases/refs/heads/main/install_onyx.sh | bash
    ```
    Upon successful installation, you should see the message "Onyx has been installed successfully."
    <Info>
      For transparency, you can review the [installation script's source code](https://github.com/onyx-hq/onyx-public-releases/blob/main/install_onyx.sh).
    </Info>
    <Accordion title="Verify Your Installation (Optional)">

      After the installation is complete, you may verify that it was successful by running:
      ```sh
      onyx --version
      ```
      and a configuration file is created at `~/.config/onyx/config.yml` by running:
      ```sh
      cat ~/.config/onyx/config.yml
      # should output something
      ```
    </Accordion>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a sample repository">
    In order to configure agents and other query settings, you need to create a sample repository. You can do this by running:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/onyx-hq/onyx-sample-repo.git
    cd onyx-sample-repo
    ```
    Start by exploring the pre-configured agents in the `agents` folder. When you're ready, customize `config.yml` to add your own agents, models, and warehouses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure onyx">
    The main configuration file is located at `~/.config/onyx/config.yml`.
    You can access it by:
    - running `open ~/.config/onyx/config.yml` in your terminal
    - or directly in your file browser (Finder on macOS, File Explorer on Windows)
      <Tip>
        To show hidden files and directories:

        - Mac: Open Finder and press `Cmd + Shift + .`
        - Windows: Open File Explorer from the taskbar, select **View > Show > Hidden items**
      </Tip>
      <img class="rounded-md" src="/images/config-screenshot.jpeg" alt="config" />

    The `config.yml` file will look like this:
    ```yaml config.yml
    warehouses:
    - name: primary_warehouse
      type: bigquery
      key_path: /path/to/key #replace
      dataset: dbt_prod_core
    - name: local
      type: duckdb
      key_path: None
      dataset: /path/to/files/ #replace

    models:
      - name: openai-4o
        vendor: openai
        model_ref: gpt-4o
        key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
      - name: openai-4o-mini
        vendor: openai
        model_ref: gpt-4o-mini
        key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
      - name: llama3.2
        vendor: ollama
        model_ref: llama3.2:latest
        api_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
        api_key: secret

    retrievals:
      - name: default
        embed_model: "bge-small-en-v1.5"
        rerank_model: "jina-reranker-v2-base-multiligual"
        top_k: 10
        factor: 5

    defaults:
      agent: default
      project_path: /path/to/project #replace
    ```

    You need to replace `/path/to/key` or `/path/to/warehouse` with the actual path to your BigQuery service key or the path to the directory where you want to store your data.
    Here is a working example with actual paths:
    ```yaml config.yml
    warehouses:
      - name: bigquery
        type: bigquery
        key_path: /Users/sampleuser/.config/onyx/project-dataset-XXXXXXXXXX.json
        dataset: dbt_prod_core
      - name: duckdbexample
        type: duckdb
        key_path: /Users/sampleuser/.config/onyx/project-dataset-XXXXXXXXXX.json
        dataset: "/Users/sampleuser/onyx/onyx-sample-repo/"

    models:
      - name: openai-4o
        vendor: openai
        key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
        model_ref: gpt-4o
      - name: openai-4o-mini
        vendor: openai
        key_var: OPENAI_API_KEY
        model_ref: gpt-4o-mini

    retrievals:
      - name: default
        embed_model: "bge-small-en-v1.5"
        rerank_model: "jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual"
        top_k: 10
        factor: 5

    defaults:
      agent: default
      project_path: /Users/sampleuser/onyx/onyx-sample-repo/
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start using onyx">
    Now that you have configured your `config.yml` file, you can start using Onyx.
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Using the CLI">
        You can use the `ask` subcommand to ask questions to your agents:
        ```sh
        onyx ask "Who is the most engaged customer?"
        ```
        and receive a response from your agents.
        There are other subcommands you can use to interact with your agents, and you can explore them by running:
        ```sh
        onyx --help
        ```
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Using the Web">
        You can run the following command to start the Onyx server:
        ```sh
        onyx serve
        ```
        and then access the chat UI via the outputted address in your browser.

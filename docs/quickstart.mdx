<Info>
  These are internal instructions in the absence of a brew formulae/cask. Some
  steps will be eventually subsumed within a single command, `brew install
  onyx/onyx`
</Info>

To get started with **onyx**, you'll have to work within the terminal. By default you
have a terminal on your macbook, which you can access through spotlight. If you want
a faster experience, you can download tried-and-true [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/), GPU-accelerated [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty),
or AI-native [Warp](https://warp.dev/).

Once you have your terminal set up, follow the commands below:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install rust">
The best way to manage rust is with rustup. Install rust by following the official guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Add cargo to your path by following the instructions at the end of the installation. Or:

```bash
# Detect the current shell
current_shell=$(basename "$SHELL")

# Append the PATH export line to the appropriate shell profile
case "$current_shell" in
  bash)
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ;;
  zsh)
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unsupported shell: $current_shell"
    ;;
esac
```

</Step>
<Step title="Install python">

Ensure that the right python version is in your path (onyx-core uses python3.11.6). There are many ways to install python, here we recommend a few ways:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Using asdf">
```sh
# Using asdf is best for amd64
brew install asdf

case $SHELL in
*bash)
echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
;;
*zsh)
echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/asdf.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
;;
esac

asdf plugin add python

asdf install python 3.11.6

asdf global python 3.11.6

````

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using mise">
```sh
# Using mise is the best for any architecture
curl https://mise.run | sh

case $SHELL in
  *bash)
    echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
;;
\*zsh)
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
;;
esac

mise install python 3.11.6

mise use python@3.11 --global

````

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Using brew">
```sh
brew install python@3.11
brew link python@3.11
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Install poetry">

```sh
pip install poetry
```

</Step>
<Step title="Clone this repository">

```sh
git clone git@github.com:onyx-hq/onyx-core.git
cd onyx-core

cd ../  # Move up a directory to ensure that the sample repo is not nested within the onyx-core repo
git clone git@github.com:onyx-hq/onyx-sample-repo.git
cd onyx-sample-repo
```

</Step>
<Step title="Build the crate from the repository">

Inside onyx-core

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Copy the binary to your path:

```sh
cp target/release/onyx /usr/local/bin/onyx
```

Then, copy the `config.yml` file into `~/.config/onyx/`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/onyx && cp example.yml ~/.config/onyx/config.yml
```

You'll have to modify the location of `warehouse.key_path` to be the location of your BigQuery service key (you can find credentials in [1password](https://hyperquery.1password.com/app#/lwrm73rxzjvbhi5hl3ludt2xcu/AllItems/lwrm73rxzjvbhi5hl3ludt2xcumv67bpwhm4f55j6e5k4y5jjnwa) for our Hyperquery data - or make your own). and modify the `project_path` to onyx-sample-repo

```sh
# Modify the location of the key_path in the config.yml file
open ~/.config/onyx/config.yml
```

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environmental variable to an API key from OpenAI. You can create an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Once you create one, you can save it by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_KEY_HERE>"

# save it into zshrc
# so that the next time you open a terminal, it will be available
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_KEY_HERE>"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

</Step>
<Step title="Test the installation">

Inside onyx-sample-repo, run: `onyx` to check that the installation worked.

/**
 * Check that the `@oxy-hq/cli` tarball carries what it needs to work.
 *
 * THE PUBLISHED PACKAGE IS NOT THE SOURCE TREE, and the difference is invisible
 * from a checkout: npm strips a file literally named `.gitignore` out of a
 * tarball. The workspace template `oxyc new` renders therefore ships as
 * `_gitignore` and is renamed at render time — and if that ever regresses, the
 * package builds, installs, tests green, and hands the first customer a repo
 * with no ignore rules, which commits `node_modules/` and every app's build
 * output on their first `git add -A`.
 *
 * Nothing else in the pipeline looks at the tarball, so this does. It is cheap:
 * `npm pack --dry-run` resolves the file list without writing anything.

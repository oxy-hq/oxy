// pnpm workspace packages, so turbo never sees them, and until recently the
// `web-app` path filter did not even match `sdk/**`. That gap is how the
// templates drifted three majors behind what web-app ships, and how two
// install-time breakages reached review instead of a runner — pnpm 10+
// refusing an undeclared dependency build script (`ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`),
// and a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` that detached each app from the customer-apps
// monorepo.
//
// Local `@oxy-hq/*` packages are substituted for the published ranges on
// purpose. The templates are allowed to be ahead of npm — they pin what the
// next publish will produce — so resolving against the registry would make
// this job fail for a release-ordering reason rather than a template defect.
// The range-vs-repo check below covers that axis statically instead.

/** Does `version` satisfy the caret `range`?
 *
 * Hand-rolled because `semver` is not resolvable from this repo root, and
 * wrong the obvious way on the first attempt — worth spelling out. A caret
 * pins the leftmost NON-ZERO component, so it means three different things:
 *
 *     ^1.2.3  ->  >=1.2.3 <2.0.0     (pins major)
 *     ^0.2.0  ->  >=0.2.0 <0.3.0     (pins MINOR — 0.x majors are not compatible)
 *     ^0.0.3  ->  >=0.0.3 <0.0.4     (pins PATCH)
 *
 * That middle case is the one that matters here: `@oxy-hq/vite-plugin` lives
 * in the 0.x range and every template pins it, so treating `^0.2.0` as
 * satisfied by `0.3.0` would print `ok` on exactly the drift this check
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * A prerelease never satisfies a non-prerelease range (`0.3.0-next.1` does
 * not satisfy `^0.3.0`), which changesets can produce.
 *
 * Only caret ranges are used today; anything else is rejected rather than
 * guessed at, so a new range form fails loudly instead of silently passing.

# The shared fixture layer the browser flows run against.
#
# ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Eleven flows under web-app/tests/agentic/flows/ could not pass, and not one
# of them failed because the product was broken. They failed because nothing
# stood up the data they read:
#
#   • the four observability flows drive `/ide/observability/*`, which needs a
#     WORKSPACE to render — the server behind them answered `/api/orgs` with
#     `[]`, so there was no project and every case timed out on its first
#     locator, a failure shape indistinguishable from a real bug;
#   • `customer-apps-oxy-starter-fleet` opens a PUBLISHED app;
#   • `partners-console-fleet` needs a partner org (Acme Consulting) with
#     managed clients, operators and a ceiling;
#   • `chat-ask-fleet` / `context-graph-fleet` / `ide-unavailable-fleet` need a
#     compiled + PROMOTED revision, or every compiled read 503s.
#
# All of that already exists as one first-party command — `oxy seed`, which
# documents itself as idempotent (crates/app/src/cli/commands/seed.rs:14) and
# folds in the partner tenants, the platform grants and the example-app deploy.
# What did not exist was (a) anything that ran it for the flows, (b) anything
# that ran `compile --promote` after it, and (c) any check that the fixtures are
# actually VISIBLE over HTTP from the node a flow will drive. (c) is the part
# that matters: a seed that writes rows nobody can read still fails every flow,
# just three minutes later and looking like a product defect.
#
# ── Why not extend the runner's setup surface ───────────────────────────────
# `web-app/tests/agentic/fixtures/reset.ts` is deliberately three commands wide
# (`goto:`, `reset_test_file`, `restore_demo_file:`) and must not make network
# calls — see the 2026-05-06 incident note in tests/agentic/README.md. So
# seeding lives out here in the shell, the same shape `scripts/seed-observability.sh`
# uses, and the runner keeps knowing nothing about databases.
#
# ── Usage ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   scripts/seed-fixtures.sh fleet     # docker fleet: seed via the ide container,
#                                      # then verify against a stateless replica
#   scripts/seed-fixtures.sh native    # a locally-running `oxy serve` / `oxy start`:
#                                      # seed via ./target/debug/oxy against its DB
#   scripts/seed-fixtures.sh check     # verify only — no writes at all
#
#   OXY_BASE_URL     where to VERIFY (default: http://127.0.0.1:3000)
#   OXY_DATABASE_URL native mode: which DB to seed (default: read out of .env)
#   FIXTURE_FLOW_EMAIL  / FIXTURE_STAFF_EMAIL  identities to mint sessions for
#
# Idempotent by construction: `oxy seed` skips rows it already wrote, `compile`
# writes a fresh revision and re-points the pointer (a new row, never a 409),
# and the MinIO bucket is created with `--ignore-existing`. Running it twice
# leaves the same fixture and the same PASS lines.
#
# ── Exit codes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   0  seeded and every fixture verified over HTTP
#   1  seeded, but a fixture is missing from the node the flows will drive
#      (a real gap — fix it, do not run flows against it and blame the product)
#   2  could not seed at all (no server, no binary, no database)

#
# `flow@oxy.local` is an ordinary org owner with NO platform standing. Every

# off every tenant workspace URL into /admin until they open an assume-role
# session, so a workspace flow signed in as staff lands on the admin console and
# times out waiting for a testid that was never going to render.
#
# `e2e@oxy.tech` is staff (OXY_OWNER). The admin + partner surfaces need it, and
# only it — `/api/customer-apps` answers a non-staff caller 403, measured.
#
# The staff address is a property of the DEPLOYMENT, not of this script, so its
# default follows the target rather than being one hardcoded value that is wrong

# the flow sees an empty page, not an error.

# the Local org (seed.rs:44-50) — org membership, not platform standing. Export
# it to the server too and `flow@oxy.local` becomes staff, which is exactly the

## The framework for agentic analytics

Oxy is an open-source framework for building comprehensive agentic analytics systems grounded in deterministic execution principles. Written in Rust and declarative by design, Oxy provides the foundational components needed to transform AI-driven data analysis into reliable, production-ready systems through structured primitives, semantic understanding, and predictable execution.

To learn more, read our [docs](https://docs.oxy.tech).

### Quickstart

To install Oxy from binary, run the following command (Mac, Linux, WSL):

```bash
bash <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://get.oxy.tech)
```

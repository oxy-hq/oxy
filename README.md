## The framework for agentic analytics

Oxy is an open-source framework for agentic analytics. It is declarative by design and written in Rust. Oxy is built with the following product principles in mind: open-source, performant, code-native, declarative, composable, and secure.

Agentic analytics applies software development lifecycle principles to AI-driven data analytics.
Just as traditional software follows a build-test-deploy pipeline, agentic analytics establishes a structured workflow for data agents, involving agent creation, prompt testing, and production deployment.

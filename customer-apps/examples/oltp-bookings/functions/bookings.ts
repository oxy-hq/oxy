// bookings — an example Oxy Function that reads and WRITES the app's own
// per-org OLTP store through `ctx.oltp`.
//
// This is the half `ctx.warehouse` cannot give an app. For a `postgres_managed`
// database `ctx.warehouse` resolves the org's read-only ANALYST — so a write
// authenticates and then fails `permission denied`, and a read sees the org's
// whole warehouse (the `raw_*` Toast/QuickBooks extracts included). `ctx.oltp`
// resolves the app's own WRITER role instead: DML rights scoped to the single
// `app_oltp_bookings` schema, and nothing else. Narrower on reads, finally writable.
//
// Declared in oxy-app.json under `functions.bookings` with
// `"oltp": { "enabled": true }` — the fail-closed capability that PERMITS
// `ctx.oltp`. It does not name a schema: the target is derived from the app's
// own slug (`oltp-bookings` → `app_oltp_bookings`), so no manifest can point at
// another app's data. Without the capability the host rejects every call.
//
// PREREQUISITE — the org operator provisions the store once, before publishing.
// The writer name matches the app slug with hyphens as underscores:
//   oxy oltp provision --org <org> --writer app:oltp_bookings
// That mints the `app_oltp_bookings_rw` role and its schema. `ctx.oltp` then
// resolves it on each call (no provider round-trip — the sealed credential is
// read from Oxy's control plane).
//
// SECURITY — every value that comes from the request is passed as a BOUND
// parameter ($1, $2, …), never concatenated into SQL. A booking form is exactly
// the surface that takes end-user input; placeholders are the only thing that
// makes it safe.
//
// TELLING PEOPLE — a new booking is announced with `ctx.notify`, which names
// PEOPLE, never addresses: whoever holds the "Host" position, plus the person
// who took the booking. The platform resolves who that is, writes each one an
// inbox row, and pushes / emails them where it can. Declared as
// `"notify": { "kinds": { "booking_created": {} } }` — a kind is what a person
// can mute in their notification settings.
//
// Invoke from the frontend with `useFunction("bookings")`:
//   const { invoke } = useFunction("bookings");
//   await invoke({ action: "create", name: "Ada", partySize: 4 });
//   const { bookings } = await invoke({ action: "list" });

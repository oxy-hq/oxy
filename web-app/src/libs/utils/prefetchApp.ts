/**
 * Warm a custom app's entry chunks before the user commits to opening it.
 *
 * **The document itself is not the win.** The shell is served `private,
 * no-cache`, so a prefetched copy has to be revalidated before the navigation
 * may reuse it — at best this saves a connection setup, not a round trip.
 *
 * What actually pays is the `Link: rel=modulepreload` header the serve path
 * attaches to that response: the browser follows it and pulls the app's entry
 * chunks, which *are* `immutable` and therefore reusable without revalidation.
 * By the time the click lands, the expensive half is already in the HTTP cache.
 * On a repeat visit the app's service worker has them precached and the whole
 * thing is instant regardless; this is the *first* visit's version of it.
 *
 * ## Why `rel=prefetch` and not `fetch()`
 *
 * A `fetch()` of the app's HTML would look exactly like a page load to the
 * serve path: it would mint a tracking session cookie and record a view row for
 * an app the user only hovered over. `rel=prefetch` instead makes the browser
 * announce itself — `Sec-Purpose` on Chrome and Edge, `X-moz` on Firefox, and
 * `Purpose` from older engines and intermediaries. The serve path checks all
 * three (`is_speculative_request`) before recording anything, so a hover stays
 * a hover in the Activity tab.
 *
 * Idempotent per URL: browsers already de-duplicate prefetches, but the check
 * also keeps `<head>` from accumulating a link per hover for the life of the
 * page.

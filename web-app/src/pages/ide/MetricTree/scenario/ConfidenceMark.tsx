 * two tokens rather than a pair of greys —
 *
 * 1. A one-character glyph in `muted-foreground` on `muted` is invisible at
 *    this size, and it sits beside coloured figures that win the eye outright.
 * 2. `success` vs `warning` is already this codebase's verified-vs-not axis
 *    (see the artifact Verified badge), and `success` is the colour the canvas
 *    strokes component edges with — the very edges that make a number exact.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `info`/`destructive`: those two are spoken for in the same
 * row, where they mean the move went up or down.

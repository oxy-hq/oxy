/**
 * Lever pairs that cannot be simulated together.
 *
 * Mirrors `oxy_airlayer_compat::lever_conflicts` deliberately, but the two no
 * longer play the same role. The Rust copy is the ENFORCING one, at three
 * points: both `/predict` handlers (`crates/app/src/server/api/metric_tree.rs`
 * and its `projects/` twin) 400 on a conflict, and the agentic analytics
 * `predict_impact` tool — which builds its own tree and never goes through
 * either handler — refuses the same set. So a caller with no browser in front
 * of it (curl, `oxyc`, an SDK integration, an agentic analytics tool, a
 * scheduled custom-app function) cannot get a confident answer out of an
 * ambiguous pinned-lever set. This copy is a pre-flight: it lets
 * `useScenario.ts` set `blocked = true` and skip the request before the round
 * trip that would otherwise come back 400. Both are checked against the same
 * case list — change one, change both.

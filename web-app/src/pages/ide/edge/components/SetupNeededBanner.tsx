/**
 * "Setup needed" prompt for cameras that exist in the workspace but
 * haven't been reviewed yet (their `analytics_consent` is still
 * `false`). Camera creation defaults to consent-off as a
 * privacy-safe starting point; this banner is the surface that
 * keeps the operator from accidentally leaving a freshly imported
 * site permanently silent.
 *
 * Hidden when no cameras are pending review so the page stays
 * clean. Click-through routes to the Devices > Cameras tab in
 * `?review=1` mode, which filters the cameras table to the
 * unreviewed set and surfaces the bulk-enable action.
 *
 * Scoped by the global SitePicker — the count and the link
 * inherit the site filter so banner action is always consistent
 * with what the operator is looking at.

 *  - `total` is 0: the workspace really has nothing in this filter. Scan CTA.
 *  - a refetch is in flight, or the page is past the end and about to be
 *    clamped: this is a beat between two responses. Spinner.
 *  - neither: `total` and the page disagree with nothing on the way to fix it.
 *    The list endpoint counts and pages in separate, non-transactional
 *    queries, so a concurrent scan (or someone else's bulk-ack) can empty a
 *    still-in-range page. Nothing will re-fetch on its own, so offer the

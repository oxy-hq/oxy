/**
 * Two SEPARATE types, deliberately not a `OrgFilter | UserFilter` union.
 *
 * The union version shipped with a reset effect whose dep array was `[]`, so an org
 * filter survived onto the user list — `"empty"` went out as `?role=empty`, the server
 * correctly resolved an unknown role to an empty allow-list, and the rail came back
 * blank with no chip lit. Two casts (`filter as UserFilter`) were the only reason that
 * typechecked; the type system would otherwise have objected that `"empty"` is not a
 * UserFilter.
 *
 * One state per entity makes that unrepresentable and deletes the reset entirely —
 * there is nothing to reset, because each list reads its own.

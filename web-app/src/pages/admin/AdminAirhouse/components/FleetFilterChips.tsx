/**
 * The fleet summary, and the filter, as one control.
 *
 * A count an operator can read but not act on is a dead end: "2 without a
 * service account" tells them something is wrong and then makes them find it by
 * eye down a list of every workspace. Making the count the filter collapses
 * report and action into one click, which is the whole interaction budget an
 * incident gets.
 *
 * Severities with no rows render disabled rather than hidden. A missing chip
 * would read as "no such state exists"; a greyed one reads as "none right now",
 * and the row of chips keeps a stable shape as the fleet changes underneath it.

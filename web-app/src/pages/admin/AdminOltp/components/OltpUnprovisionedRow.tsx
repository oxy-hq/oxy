/**
 * An org with no database: a name and the one action that applies.
 *
 * Deliberately not the same row as a provisioned tenant. Rendering these
 * through the shared table meant three columns of `—` repeated for every org
 * that had not been provisioned yet — on a fresh deployment that is nearly the
 * whole page, and it made a list of *absences* as visually heavy as the list of
 * real databases.
 *
 * A plain `<button>`, not `<Button>`: the shared button carries `.t-button`,
 * which sets font-size and weight from CSS variables in an unlayered rule, so a
 * `text-[11px]` utility on the element does not win and the label renders at
 * 14px/500 — heavier than the org name it belongs to. Several admin call sites
 * pass `text-[11px]` to `<Button>` today and silently get 14px. Micro-actions
 * in this surface are plain buttons; `<Button>` stays for the real ones.

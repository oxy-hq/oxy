/**
 * Said before a build goes live: the required keys it declares that the target
 * environment has no value for. A warning, never a gate — a key may be about to
 * be set, or the code may cope without it — but a promote that silently ships a
 * webhook answering 401 to every delivery is the failure this exists to name.
 *
 * Said where no plan is read: a first publish. The
 * console's Promote draft and Roll back confirm on the move's plan instead, where
 * `required_secrets_unset` blocks a promote (as it refuses `oxyc promote`) and a
 * rollback only warns.
 *
 * Reconciled server-side (`GET …/secrets?build=`) against the build being
 * promoted, not the one live now: the new build is what may declare a new key.
 * While that answer is on its way it says so, rather than reading as "nothing
 * missing"; a caller confirming the promote also waits for it (`AppLifecycle`).

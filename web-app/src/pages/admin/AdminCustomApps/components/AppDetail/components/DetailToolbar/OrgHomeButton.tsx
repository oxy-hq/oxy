/**
 * "Org home" — the org's HQ launcher on its own subdomain.
 *
 * Sits beside **Act as org** because the two answer adjacent questions and get
 * confused: this one *looks at* the org's launcher (does the app card appear? is it
 * restricted?), while Act-as *becomes* the org (real data, audited, closes admin for
 * 60 minutes). Grouping them makes the cheap check the obvious first move.
 *
 * **The URL comes from the server, not from `window.location`.** Deriving it here by
 * swapping the leftmost hostname label would be a second, weaker copy of
 * `org_subdomain_zone()` and would be wrong in the two ways that matter: the zone is
 * `OXY_ORG_SUBDOMAIN_ZONE` (only derived from the API URL when the admin host's
 * first label is exactly `app`), so from `app-staging.oxygen-hq.com` the guess would
 * point at the PRODUCTION org host — a confident answer about the wrong database.
 * And org subdomains are **opt-in per org**: without an enabled `org_subdomains`
 * row, the host 302s to the app root, so the button would silently land the operator
 * on their own home while claiming to show the org's.
 *
 * So: render only when the server says the org has one enabled.

/**
 * The one thing this region exists to say: **a save here is not live.**
 *
 * airway installs the deployment tier into a process-wide `OnceLock` at worker
 * startup and refuses every later call, so an edit changes what the *next*
 * process installs and nothing about the ones running. Three states, and the
 * third is the one that has to resist being rounded up to the first:
 *
 * - `drifted` — configured and installed differ. Names the settings and asks
 *   for a restart.
 * - `in_sync` — this process installed exactly what is configured.
 * - `unknown` — nothing was observed, so nothing is claimed. Rendered as a
 *   dashed, neutral panel, never as a tick.
 *
 * The `unknown` copy has to track where the install happens. It once explained
 * a missing install in terms of *runs* — true when `install_once` sat at the
 * top of `run_pipeline`. It no longer is: every oxy process that can build an
 * airway connector installs at boot (`crates/app/src/airway_boot.rs`), under
 * every `OXY_ROLE`, so a replica running this build and reporting no install
 * did not merely skip a run — its boot install did not succeed, and that is a
 * `warn` in its log an operator should go and read.
 *
 * What it must still not claim is that drift is impossible. `installed()` is
 * per-process by construction, this is one replica's answer, and a rolling
 * deploy is exactly when the replicas disagree — so the last sentence stays:
 * nothing is asserted about any other process.

              below (which is not reported separately while nothing is installed). It was logged as

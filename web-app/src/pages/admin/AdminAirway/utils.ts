/**
 * The Save confirm gate, derived from a preview query's state — never from
 * its `data` alone. `data` is `undefined` in situations that are NOT "no
 * failures": before the operator has ever asked for a preview, and whenever
 * the fetch errors. Both used to fall through `?? 0` straight to an
 * unconfirmed save, which is exactly the outage this page exists to prevent
 * (e.g. `require_declared` on `rest_api` halting all ~24 pipelines with zero
 * confirmation). Absence of data means "unknown", not "zero" — this type
 * makes that a case the caller must handle, not a number that quietly means
 * two different things.
 *
 * Every state this has been through, and why each is here:
 *
 * - **`never-previewed`** covers a genuinely un-asked preview *and* a closed
 *   disclosure. React Query serves cached data for an unchanged key even with
 *   `enabled: false`, so `isSuccess` can be `true` off a stale cache hit; a
 *   preview the operator is not looking at is not a preview.
 * - **`incomplete`** is a real coverage gap: `resources` can be `[]` (so
 *   `failingCount === 0`) while every pipeline of the kind sits in
 *   `unevaluated` — a bad definition, a required field an airway bump just
 *   added, a connector the environment refuses. Coverage being incomplete is
 *   not the same fact as coverage being clean.
 *
 *   It keys on `unevaluated` **only**. It must not key on
 *   `uncompiled_workspaces`, which the server reports separately for exactly
 *   this reason: on any real deployment at least one workspace has never
 *   compiled, so a gate that counted those would sit in `incomplete` forever
 *   and confirm every save. A confirmation that always fires is worse than
 *   none — it trains operators to click through the guardrail. The server
 *   still reports the count and the UI still shows it; it is honest to report
 *   and wrong to gate on, because a workspace with nothing compiled has no
 *   pipelines of this kind to check.
 *
 * - **`partial-scope`** is `out_of_scope_pipelines`, and it splits on the
 *   **write tier** — which is why it is not simply excluded alongside
 *   `uncompiled_workspaces`. Those pipelines really were not scored, and the
 *   count is non-zero on *every* request a bounded grant makes: it is a
 *   property of the grant, not of the draft. Gating on it unconditionally
 *   would therefore confirm every save a scoped operator ever performs — the
 *   confirmation-fatigue failure this note already describes once.
 *
 *   But fatigue is the right reading only because the *save* is bounded too,
 *   and that holds for exactly one tier. An **override** lands on one
 *   workspace inside the caller's scope, which the preview did cover, so
 *   `clean` is a true statement about what that save touches. A **global** row
 *   is fleet-wide by construction, and the preview provably did *not* score
 *   `out_of_scope_pipelines` of the pipelines it will govern. A scope-bounded
 *   `global_admin` could flip `toast` to `require_declared`, see a clean scan
 *   of their two orgs, and save with no confirmation for a change that halts
 *   pipelines in tenants they cannot see — "reads as safe, means unknown",
 *   which is the shape this whole gate exists to prevent.
 *
 *   So it fires for the global tier only, and only when the count is non-zero.
 *   That is not a confirmation that always fires: it fires on a *global* policy
 *   flip made by a bounded grant, which is rare, high-stakes, and always
 *   partially blind. Override saves are unaffected, and an unbounded grant
 *   (count `0`) never sees it. It is still surfaced in `PreviewResults` too,
 *   next to the counts it qualifies.
 *
 *   Checked **after** `incomplete`: both mean "impact unknown", and a
 *   `unevaluated` entry names a pipeline the operator can actually go and read,
 *   while this one names nothing they are allowed to see.
 * - **`stale`** is the content check behind the cache key. Every previous fix
 *   here made trust a function of *query state* — `isSuccess`, then
 *   `isSuccess && previewOpen` — and each time a way was found for the state
 *   to be right while the body described different settings. The body now
 *   echoes the `(contract_policy, environment)` it was computed under, so this
 *   compares that against the draft being saved instead of inferring it. The
 *   query key covers both axes, so this should be unreachable; it is here
 *   because "should be unreachable" is what the last two versions of this
 *   function also believed.
 *
 * `environment` is a real admission axis, not cosmetic — `source_factory`
 * refuses connectors under `Sandbox` — so a preview computed under
 * `production` says nothing about a `sandbox` save.

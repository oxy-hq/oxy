/**
 * Execution tests for the two browser scripts the server injects into every
 * custom app — `sw.js` and `runtime.js`, which live in
 * `crates/app/src/server/api/custom_apps_client/` and reach the browser via
 * `include_str!`.
 *
 * ## Why they are tested from here
 *
 * They are browser code, and this repo has exactly one JavaScript test runner.
 * The Rust side can assert *structure* — that a handler is registered, that
 * `strip_comments` did not eat a brace — and it did, and those assertions all
 * passed while both scripts carried logic bugs that quietly undid the feature
 * they exist for: the worker deleted the precache it had just built, and the
 * runtime reported every session's engagement twice. Neither is visible without
 * running the code, so the code is run here.
 *
 * The scripts are read off disk rather than imported: they are not modules, they
 * are self-installing scripts that expect a `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` or a
 * `window`. Each test evaluates one in a sandbox with just enough of that global
 * to reach the branch under test.

// Compile-time guards for the two `monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.api`
// mappings in tsconfig.app.json. monaco 0.56 stopped exporting that path, but
// `@monaco-editor/react` (for `Monaco`) and `monaco-types` (for
// `configureMonacoYaml`'s parameter, via `monaco-yaml`) still import it from
// inside their own `.d.ts` files, where `skipLibCheck: true` swallows the
// failed resolution. Without something here, deleting a mapping as an unneeded
// workaround — or monaco moving the file again — leaves every check green while
// those two APIs quietly stop being typed.
//
// Guarding the CONSUMER types only half works, and which half is not a matter
// of taste. Measured against this tsc by deleting each mapping in turn:
//
//   `configureMonacoYaml`'s parameter degrades to an empty namespace (its
//   source, `monaco-types`, does `export *` from the vanished module), and a
//   structural `extends { editor: unknown }` catches that.
//
//   `Monaco` degrades to TypeScript's *error* type, which is assignable in
//   both directions and answers no type-level predicate the way `any` does:
//   `0 extends 1 & T`, `unknown extends T`, and a tuple-wrapped structural
//   check were all tried against the real degraded type and all three PASS.
//   None of the three catches it against this tsc; treat that as measured
//   rather than as a proof that no predicate could, and re-test after a
//   TypeScript upgrade before relying on it.
//
// So resolution is guarded where it can actually fail loudly: by importing both
// mapped specifiers here. This is a `.ts` file, not a dependency's `.d.ts`, so
// `skipLibCheck` does not apply and an unresolvable module is a hard TS2307.

// `any` (a structural check can't see it — a conditional with an `any` check
// type yields the union of both branches, so `true | never` = `true`), and the

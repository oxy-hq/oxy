 * org that has no workspace yet (`/<org>/onboarding?settings=organization.crew`).
 * An unknown value is dropped rather than opening the wrong section; the
 * dialog's own gates decide what the viewer may see once it is open — a
 * valid section the viewer cannot see (a workspace section on an org with
 * none, a cloud section in local mode) falls to the first visible one, which
 * is why this hook needs no mode guard of its own.

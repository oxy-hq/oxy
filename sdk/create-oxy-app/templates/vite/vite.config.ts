// `oxyApp()` handles everything Oxy-specific: it validates `oxy-app.json`
// against the SDK's schema, copies it (and the icon / art it names) into the
// build output, proxies `/api` to your local oxy server in dev, and resolves
// the base path and output directory the bundle is served from.
//
// The output directory is `oxy-app.json`'s `build.outDir` (default `out`,
// which is also what `oxyc publish` ships) — set it there, not here, so the
// two cannot disagree.
//
// The base path resolves from (in order):
//   1. `OXY_APP_BASE_PATH` — `oxyc publish` sets this from the org it resolves
//      for the target environment, so the org is never hardcoded here.
//   2. `/customer-apps/<orgSlug>/<slug>/` from `oxy-app.json`, when it names
//      an `orgSlug`.
//   3. `/` — the dev fallback, fine for `pnpm dev` and a standalone build.

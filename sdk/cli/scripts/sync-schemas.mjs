/**
 * Copy `json-schemas/` from the repo root into this package.
 *
 * COPIED, NOT COMMITTED. The schemas are generated from the Rust config types
 * by `oxy gen-config-schema`, and `crates/app`'s `json_schemas_are_current`
 * test asserts the committed copies still match those types. A second
 * committed copy in here would be a second thing to keep in step, and the one
 * that silently rots — so it is gitignored and rebuilt.
 *
 * Runs as `prebuild`, so `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` (via `pretest` → `tsdown`)
 * and `prepublishOnly` all get a current set without anyone remembering.

# Which oxy environment does this run publish to?
#
# One line of logic, in its own file for the same reason discover-apps.sh is:
# a `run:` block cannot be executed anywhere but a runner, so anything left
# inline is unexecuted code until the first real push. This is the mapping the
# whole dev/prod split rests on, so it is the last thing that should be
# unexecuted.
#
# It also has exactly one caller and one answer ON PURPOSE. The name printed
# here is used TWICE by publish.yaml — as `oxy publish --env <name>` and as the
# GitHub Actions `environment:` whose secrets that publish authenticates with —
# and those two must never disagree. Two ternaries in the YAML would have been
# shorter and would have drifted the first time one of them was edited; one
# value, resolved once and read twice, cannot.
#
# Contract:
#   $1        the trigger, defaulting to $GITHUB_EVENT_NAME. Passed explicitly
#             only by the tests.
#   stdout    the environment name on one line: `dev` or `production`.
#   exit 0    only for a trigger this repo has a mapping for.
#   exit 1    for anything else, INCLUDING an empty trigger.
#
# The refusal is the point. `oxy publish` defaults `--env` to **production**,
# so a workflow that omits the flag ships a customer's live environment while
# looking like it did nothing in particular — which is exactly what this repo's
# CI did before this file existed. Every publish now names its environment out
# loud, and a trigger nobody has thought about fails here rather than falling
# through to the most dangerous of the two.

#   stdout  one line per app, "<app-dir><TAB><out-dir>", relative to the repo
#           root, sorted. Empty when the repo has no apps.

#           its CI must be green on day one — a template that ships a red
#           check teaches the team to stop reading checks.
#   exit 1  only for a repo that HAS apps and cannot publish them: a manifest
#           that will not parse, an app with no resolvable identity, or a
#           missing lockfile.
#   $GITHUB_OUTPUT gains `count=<n>` when that variable is set, so the

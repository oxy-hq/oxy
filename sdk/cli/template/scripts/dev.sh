# It is two processes, and neither is guessable from the outside — which is
# why this file exists at all. Before it, running an app locally needed three
# commands in two terminals and knowledge that was written down nowhere:
#
#   oxy proxy --env <env>     background, listens on :3000. Forwards the app's
#                             /api calls to the cloud, signed with the token
#                             `oxy login --env <env>` cached.
#   pnpm dev  (in the app)    foreground, Vite on :5173, which proxies /api to
#                             :3000. That target is the Vite plugin's default,
#                             so the proxy's port is not really negotiable —
#                             hence no --port flag here.
#
# Started in that order and torn down together. The proxy is killed on EXIT,
# INT and TERM, because a proxy left holding :3000 after a Ctrl-C makes the
# NEXT run fail with a port conflict that names nothing anyone remembers.
#
# Usage: pnpm dev --env <env> [app] [--allow-writes] [--allow-events] [--yes]

# `.github/scripts/discover-apps.sh` is this repo's one answer to "which apps
# does it hold, and where does each build land", and publish.yaml calls the
# same file — so a dev run and a publish can never disagree about what counts
# as an app. Calling a script out of .github/ from a dev script reads oddly,
# and the tidier-looking fix (move it to scripts/, repoint the workflow) trades
# that oddness for a workflow whose script path is wrong on the first push.
# The oddness is cheaper. It lives there because that is where the workflow

                  a full URL (--env https://acme.oxygen-hq.com), or any name
                  the app's own oxy-app.json declares under "environments".
  [app]           Which app to run, when this repo holds more than one. Its
                  directory (apps/acme/reports) or just its name (reports).
  --allow-writes  Forward side-effecting calls instead of holding them.
  --allow-events  Forward tracking events instead of dropping them.
  --yes           Confirm that --env production is really what you meant.
  -h, --help      This text.

# What each of the three actually buys, measured rather than assumed — bash 3.2,
# signal delivered while this script sits in the liveness `sleep` below:
#
#   EXIT   does the work on every path tried, INCLUDING death by an untrapped
#          SIGTERM: bash runs it there too. It is the one that matters.
#   INT    load-bearing, and not for the reason it looks. A job started in the
#          background inherits SIGINT set to IGNORE, so WITHOUT this line a
#          SIGINT aimed at this script alone is discarded — the script sails on
#          and starts the dev server the person just tried to stop (measured:
#          exit 0, no teardown). Installing the trap un-ignores the signal.
#   TERM   defensive, and honestly so: every window tried already produced 143
#          and a clean teardown through EXIT. It is kept because it makes the
#          status explicit instead of leaning on bash running an EXIT handler
#          for a fatal signal, which is not a portable guarantee — but there is
#          no test for it, because none could fail.

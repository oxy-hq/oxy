/**
 * The browser check `oxyc checks run --browser` adds to an app's checks: load
 * the app in headless Chromium and prove it mounted — in a NAMED environment.
 *
 * Same proof as the release checks' `web-app/tests/custom-app-checks/app-loads.spec.ts`:
 * a custom-app host answers 200 with the app shell for every path, so a status
 * code proves nothing; the platform runtime's `oxy-app-ready` beacon (sent once
 * the app has laid out) does. What this adds is the environment.
 *
 * HOW THE ENVIRONMENT REACHES THE APP'S REQUESTS. The page loads on the path
 * URL (`{target}/customer-apps/{org}/{app}/`), and a context-wide route handler
 * adds the caller's credential and `X-Oxy-App-Env` to every request under that
 * base, on that origin: the document, its assets, the beacon and the app's own
 * `/fn` calls. The server resolves the environment of each from that header
 * (`custom_app_env_request::request_environment`; the path URL has no host
 * label to outrank it), and honours it only beside an explicit credential,
 * which is why the credential rides along. NOT `extraHTTPHeaders`: that would
 * hand the credential to every origin the page touches, a font CDN included.
 * NOT the sandbox host: it authenticates by the session cookie, which a staff
 * token cannot become, and a sandbox whose name is too long has no host at
 * all. Service workers are blocked so no request escapes the route handler.
 *
 * NOTHING OUTSIDE THE APP'S BASE GETS THE CREDENTIAL, same origin or not. The
 * page runs on the deployment's own origin, beside the whole API, and its code
 * is the build under test — often one an agent or an app operator published.
 * A credential on every same-origin request would let that code call
 * `/api/admin/…` (a promote, a token mint) as the person running the check.
 * So the app's `/api/…` calls go without it, as an anonymous visitor's would:
 * an app that will not mount without its data fails the check rather than
 * borrowing the operator's authority.
 *
 * THE CHECK VERIFIES ITSELF. The served document carries the environment and
 * the build in `window.__OXY_APP__`; a page reporting any other environment —
 * or, for a sandbox or staging, any build but the one that environment serves
 * — fails, so a header lost on the way can never pass against production.

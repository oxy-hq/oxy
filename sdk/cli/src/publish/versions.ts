/**
 * Is the app building against a kit `oxyc` knows to be old?
 *
 * The manifest contract, the function runtime's types and the Vite plugin's
 * build move together; an app pinned to an SDK several minors behind the one
 * this `oxyc` was built beside validates against a contract the server has
 * outgrown, and finds out at the first call. This says so at publish — ONE
 * line per package, a warning, never a refusal: the publish is the author's
 * call, and a pin is often deliberate.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. The versions compared against are the sibling packages' at the
 * time `oxyc` was built (`scripts/emit-version.mjs` bakes them in), and the
 * app's are read from its `package.json` — the installed copy under
 * `node_modules` when there is one, else the declared range's floor.

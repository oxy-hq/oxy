 * ONE CONTRACT. The shape is `OxyAppManifest` from `@oxy-hq/sdk/manifest` —
 * the type the JSON Schema is generated from — and `loadPublishManifest` runs
 * the SDK's validator over the file before anything is built, so a publish
 * refuses exactly what `oxyc validate` and the Vite plugin refuse, in the same
 * words. The name rules (`isValidSlug`, `isValidFunctionName`) come from the
 * same module; this file used to carry its own copies of both.
 *
 * `context/target.ts` owns identity and `environments` and reads the file
 * leniently, because a command told `--target` must not fail on a manifest it
 * does not need. This is the strict read.

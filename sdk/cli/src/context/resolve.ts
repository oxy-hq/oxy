/**
 * The merge point of the two tools.
 *
 * `oxyc`'s customer half knows WHO — which customer, where their repo is, what
 * org they are. `oxyc`'s API half knows HOW to ask a deployment a question.
 * This is what joins them: one resolution that produces both halves, so
 * `oxyc api {org}/workspaces` works from inside a customer repo without
 * anyone typing an id.
 *
 * `gh api` does the same trick with `{owner}` and `{repo}` read off the git
 * remote, and it is the single feature that makes that command usable from
 * memory. Everything here exists to make ours as cheap to use.
 *
 * RESOLUTION IS LAZY AND PARTIAL, deliberately. `oxyc routes` needs a target
 * and no customer; `oxyc list` needs neither. Resolving everything eagerly
 * would make a command fail on a fact it never uses — which is how a tool
 * ends up demanding a GitHub login to print its own help.

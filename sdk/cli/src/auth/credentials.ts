/**
 * The token cache — the SAME file the Rust `oxy` binary reads and writes.
 *
 * Interop is the whole point: `oxy login` and `oxyc login` must be
 * interchangeable, so one tool logging in authenticates the other. That makes
 * the on-disk shape a contract with a program written in another language, and
 * every constant below is transcribed from `crates/app/src/cli/commands/login.rs`
 * rather than chosen here.
 *
 * THE PATH IS NOT `~/.config` ON macOS, whatever the Rust doc comment says.
 * `login.rs` builds it from `dirs::config_dir()`, and that crate returns
 * `$HOME/Library/Application Support` on macOS — verified against a live
 * credentials file. A `~/.config/oxy` implementation would read an empty store
 * on every Mac in the company and report every developer as logged out while
 * the Rust binary saw them logged in. `configDir()` reproduces the crate's
 * platform rules, and `credentials.test.ts` pins them.

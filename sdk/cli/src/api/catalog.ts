/**
 * What endpoints exist, and what each one expects.
 *
 * Discovery is the reason this tool is worth building for an agent: without it
 * the caller needs a checkout to know the surface, and the whole premise is a
 * caller who has neither a checkout nor a doc site open.
 *
 * The Rust `oxy api` answered this from data baked into the binary at build
 * time — `crates/app/build_route_catalog.rs` walks the axum router source and
 * emits a table. That has one flaw this design fixes: the table describes the
 * routes the BINARY could mount, and several mounts are mode-conditional, so a
 * listed path can still 404 on the deployment in front of you. Asking the
 * deployment is strictly more truthful.
 *
 * It costs an authenticated network call, so the answer is cached per host and
 * a failure degrades to STALE AND SAID SO rather than to nothing — the
 * discipline `customer-tooling`'s `lib/customers.sh` writes down at length,
 * and for the same reason: an empty answer here reads as "this deployment has
 * no such route", which is a lie that sends the caller off to debug the wrong
 * thing.

/**
 * `oxyc mcp` — the Oxy API as MCP tools, over stdio.
 *
 * NOT THE SAME THING AS `oxy mcp`. That one is workspace tooling: it takes a
 * local checkout and exposes the semantic model, automations and `.sql` files
 * in it. This one takes a TOKEN and exposes the deployment's HTTP API — the
 * same surface `oxyc api` reaches, for an agent that would rather call a tool
 * than shell out. Different input, different audience, no overlap.
 *
 * FOUR TOOLS, NOT SIX HUNDRED — the design decision that makes this affordable.
 *
 * The obvious shape is one tool per endpoint, and it is the wrong one: the API
 * has ~670 routes, an agent runtime ships every tool's JSON schema in every
 * request, and that is tens of kilobytes of context spent on each turn before
 * a single question is asked. It would also go stale on every deploy, since
 * the tool list would be baked into this package rather than read from the
 * deployment.
 *
 * So discovery stays a QUESTION the agent asks (`routes`, `schema`) rather
 * than a payload it carries, exactly as the CLI does it. Four tools cost a few
 * hundred bytes per turn and reach every endpoint, including ones added after
 * this package was published.
 *
 * Auth, target resolution and placeholder substitution are the CLI's — the
 * same `Context`, so a token cached by `oxyc login` (or `oxy login`) works
 * here with no separate setup, and `{org}` / `{workspace}` resolve the same
 * way.

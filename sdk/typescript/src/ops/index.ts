// `@oxy-hq/sdk/ops` — the operating graph, applied inside an Oxy Function.
//
// The platform states where a caller may act (`ctx.user.reach`, derived from
// their assignments — see `internal-docs/operating-graph.md` §3.3); this is
// how a function applies it. Library code, versioned with the SDK, and
// replaceable: an app that needs a tighter rule wraps `reachOf` and keeps the
// rest. It may tighten, never widen — the reach the platform hands in is the
// ceiling.
//
// Lifted from Store Ops's `functions/access.ts` (customer-apps #138) minus its
// roster SQL: the roster is the platform's now, so the decision arrives on
// `ctx.user` and nothing here reads a table.
//
// Two entry points. `requireReach` for a writer that names a location: the
// 403 to return, or null. `predicate` for a reader: a SQL expression over the
// statement's own location column, bound through the statement's parameter
// list, so the scope lives in the WHERE — before the LIMIT, so a page is a
// page of the right set.

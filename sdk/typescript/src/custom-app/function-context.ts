// Author-facing types for **Oxy Functions** — the server-side TypeScript
// handlers bundled inside a custom app (`functions/<name>.ts`, declared in
// `oxy-app.json`). Each function is `export default async (req, ctx) => Response`.
//
// Until now functions were written untyped: the `ctx` object is assembled
// entirely by the Rust host (`__buildCtx` in
// `crates/app/src/server/api/custom_apps_functions/runtime.rs`) and never had
// a TypeScript counterpart. `OxyFunctionContext` below is that counterpart —
// it mirrors the host-provided `ctx.*` members one-for-one so function authors
// get autocomplete + type-checking. Import it as:
//
// ```ts
// import type { OxyFunctionContext, OxyFunctionRequest } from "@oxy-hq/sdk";
//
// export default async function notify(req: OxyFunctionRequest, ctx: OxyFunctionContext) {
//   const html = render(Welcome, { name });
//   const { messageId } = await ctx.email.send({ to, subject, html });
//   return Response.json({ ok: true, messageId });
// }
// ```

   * `database` must be in this function's manifest `destinations` — a
   * transaction is a write, and the same fail-closed allowlist applies. Postgres
   * only; other backends reject `ctx.tx` rather than faking it.
   *
   * **Do not catch a failed statement and return normally.** A statement the
   * server rejects aborts the whole transaction, and `COMMIT` on an aborted
   * transaction does not fail — Postgres applies nothing and reports success —
   * so `ctx.tx` refuses to commit and throws instead, naming the statement that
   * poisoned it. Let the error propagate.
   *
   * ```ts
   * const orderId = await ctx.tx("appdb", async (tx) => {
   *   const [{ id }] = await tx.query(
   *     "INSERT INTO orders (table_no) VALUES ($1) RETURNING id",
   *     [tableNo],
   *   );
   *   for (const it of items) {
   *     await tx.exec(
   *       "INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, sku, qty) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)",
   *       [id, it.sku, it.qty],
   *     );
   *   }
   *   return id;
   * });
   * ```

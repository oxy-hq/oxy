// Manifest loader for custom-app bundles served by oxy at
// `app.oxygen-hq.com/customer-apps/<org_slug>/<app_slug>/`.
//
// The bundle commits a `public/oxy-app.json` declaring its identity
// (slug, orgSlug, projectId). This module:
//   1. Fetches that manifest at startup (cached after the first call).
//   2. Validates the schema with clear errors (v2 only — v1 is rejected).
//   3. Joins it with the runtime identity oxy injects via
//      `<script>window.__OXY_APP__=...</script>`.
//
// Bundles call `useQuery` directly for data access — there are no
// `products` or `writers` declarations in v2 manifests.

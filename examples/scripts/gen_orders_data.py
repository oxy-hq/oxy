"""Give the orders demo dataset a real, actionable driver of order value.

Why this exists
---------------
Order value used to be drawn independently of everything else in the dataset.
Mean order value by status came out 541.4 / 539.8 / 545.8 / 541.1 — four
statistically identical numbers — and nothing else about an order predicted what
it was worth either. That is a problem for a demo whose whole pitch is "here is
where your upside is", because there was no upside to find: every "lever" the
Opportunities panel could surface was, necessarily, sampling noise. It duly
surfaced `order_status` as a "+42.7k biggest lever" and the apartment line of
the shipping address as the third.

So this script installs one honest, actionable driver — the sales channel — and
leaves everything else alone, deliberately including `status`, which *should*
have no effect on order value and whose continued flatness is how we check the
significance gate is doing its job on real data rather than just in unit tests.

What it preserves
-----------------
Three invariants hold across the current fixture at 100%, and other measures are
quietly built on them, so this script derives rather than overwrites:

- `orders.total_amount == SUM(qty * unit_price * (1 - discount_percent/100))`
  over the order's line items. `orders.total_order_value` is defined as
  `{{order_items.total_revenue}}` — the line-item side — while `gross_revenue`
  is `SUM(total_amount)`. The two agree to the cent only because of this, and
  `net_revenue` straddles both.
- `orders.tax_amount == round(total_amount * 0.08, 2)`.
- `orders.shipping_cost == SUM(order_shipments.shipping_cost)`, owned entirely
  by `order_shipments.csv`. Untouched here — and the 12,301 orders with no
  shipment rows must stay at 0.0.

Row counts, ids, and every foreign key are preserved exactly. Only `unit_price`
moves; `total_amount` and `tax_amount` are recomputed from it.

Usage
-----
    python3 examples/scripts/gen_orders_data.py [--anchor YYYY-MM-DD] [--check]

`--check` verifies the invariants against what is already on disk and writes
nothing. Deterministic: same seed and anchor in, same bytes out.

If you re-run this with a new anchor, note that a few files hard-code the
dataset's span and will not follow it: `fruit_business_monitor.app.yml` and
`apps/controls_demo.app.yml` pin `order_date` bounds, and `.monitor.yml`'s
header comment quotes a reference date. A stale window there is invisible — the
filter stays valid, the window just goes empty, and the dashboard still looks
like it works.

# Sizing note — the gap has to be big enough to *prove*, not just to exist. A
# city-scoped 90d slice is ~900 orders over 4 channels, so ~225 per segment; at
# an order-value spread of ~360 that is a standard error of ~24 per segment and
# ~34 on the difference. The significance gate at k=4 asks for ~2.24 SE, i.e.
# ~76. The mobile gap lands near 150 — comfortably provable in a single city,

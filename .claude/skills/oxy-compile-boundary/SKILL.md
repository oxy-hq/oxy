description: Use when adding a new YAML entity type to Oxy (e.g. a new file extension under `crates/oxy-compile/src/walker.rs` like `.foo.yml`), when introducing a new runtime read site that walks the workspace filesystem, when wiring a new handler that calls `ConfigManager::resolve_*` or `fs::read_to_string(workspace_path...)`, or any time someone proposes a feature that "just reads from the workspace dir." Also triggers on phrases like "new file extension", "add a YAML config", "load this from disk", "scan the workspace for", "read the YAML file" — the compile boundary expects every NEW workspace artifact to be a row in Postgres, not a per-request FS read.

# Compile every workspace artifact to Postgres

Oxy's runtime no longer walks the workspace filesystem on customer-facing requests. PR #2460 (the compile boundary work) made every YAML entity addressable as a `*_definitions` row keyed by `revision_id`. The IDE Compile button promotes a revision and every read site serves from Postgres until the next compile. The boundary is always on — there are no feature flags; readers fall through to the filesystem on any miss.

This skill is the rule for **anyone adding a new file type** the runtime needs to read. Skip this skill only when the read is genuinely IDE-only (file CRUD, git ops) or a one-time onboarding write.

## The contract: when you add a new `.foo.yml`

You owe **all five of these** before the feature ships. Skipping any one of them means the new file walks FS on every customer request — exactly what we just stopped doing.

1. **Walker** — add a `FileKind::Foo` variant in `crates/oxy-compile/src/walker.rs` and a glob in `discover()` so a compile pass finds the file. Root-only files go into the explicit `if path.is_file()` block (see `Config` and `MonitorConfig` as templates). Glob patterns go through `push_glob`.

2. **Compile output** — add `CompiledRow::Foo(CompiledFoo { ... })` in `crates/oxy-compile/src/compile.rs`, a match arm in `compile_one()`, and a `row_dedupe_key` entry (or `None` if the file is a singleton like `config.yml` / `.monitor.yml`). For named entities (agents, views, topics) use `compile_named_yaml` — it handles the `name`/`file_path`/`definition` shape uniformly. For singletons, write a small `compile_foo()` that parses and emits one row.

3. **Schema** — append the new table to the squashed migration `crates/migration/src/m20260606_000002_create_compile_boundary.rs` (BOTH `up()` and the reverse-order `down()`). Add a `MonitorConfigs`-style `DeriveIden` enum at the end of the file. The FK convention is `from(Foo::Table, Foo::RevisionId).to(Revisions::Table, Revisions::RevisionId).on_delete(ForeignKeyAction::Cascade)`. Add the matching entity file under `crates/entity/src/foo_definitions.rs` and register it in `crates/entity/src/lib.rs`.

4. **Writer** — add a `CompiledRow::Foo(f) => foos.push(...)` arm in `crates/oxy-compile/src/writer.rs`, declare the `let mut foos = Vec::new()` near the top of the function, and add the bulk-insert call near the end. The order mirrors the existing kinds.

5. **Reader + handler wiring** — add `resolve_foo` (and `list_foos` if applicable) to `crates/app/src/server/api/compiled_reader.rs`. They follow the `open_compiled_revision` → `find_by_id` shape. Then wire the runtime handler:
   - If the handler accepts a string / struct: read the compiled row, deserialise from the JSONB definition, fall through to FS on miss.
   - If the handler accepts a `Path` (e.g. an external library like `airlayer` or `oxy_metric_monitoring`): use the materialiser pattern in `crates/app/src/server/api/semantic_scan.rs` — write the Postgres bytes to a `tempfile::TempDir`, pass that path, hold the `TempDir` guard until the call returns.

`open_compiled_revision` already handles the branch carve-out + revision lookup for every reader — you do not need to re-implement it per-surface.

### S3 blob storage (semantic views / topics only)

Large semantic view / topic bodies move to S3 when `OXY_COMPILE_BLOB_S3_BUCKET` is set. The compile worker uploads each body to `s3://<bucket>/workspaces/<workspace_id>/{semantic_views,semantic_topics}/<name>-<sha[..32]>.yml` and stores the key in `semantic_views.compiled_sql_blob_key` / `semantic_topics.compiled_sql_blob_key`. The materialiser (`crates/app/src/server/api/semantic_scan.rs`) prefers the S3 blob over the in-row JSONB. When the env var is unset, blob_key is NULL and the in-row `definition` is the canonical body — Postgres-only deployments work unchanged.

If you add a new entity type whose definition routinely tops tens of KB (the way semantic views do), follow the same shape: add a nullable `compiled_sql_blob_key` column, wire the upload in `oxy-compile`'s writer, and extend `oxy_compile::blob_store::BlobKind`. Small definitions (apps, agents, automations) stay JSONB-only — the S3 round-trip costs more than the row bloat at typical sizes.

## Why this matters

The original FS read pattern was the dominant runtime cost at any meaningful workspace count. The IDE works on a singleton instance (FS-backed working copy); the customer-facing `oxy-serve` fleet must never read workspace files because those instances may not have them. Every new file type you skip the compile boundary on is a new failure mode under multi-instance.

## What's NOT in scope

Skip this contract only when:
- The file is purely IDE-editor state (already on the singleton, fine).
- The artifact is a generated build product (charts, parquet caches, custom-app bundles) — those belong in S3, not the compile boundary.
- The read happens exactly once at server startup, not per-request (startup walks of `OXY_STATE_DIR` are fine).

If you find yourself adding a `glob::glob(workspace_path)` or `fs::read_to_string(workspace_path.join(...))` in a request handler and the path is not already a compiled entity, you are on the wrong path. Open this skill and add the file type to the compile boundary first.

### Absent is not empty (and two rules that keep it that way)

A fallback that reads a filesystem which is not there must fail, not return nothing. Every enumeration that returned `[]` for a missing workspace root is how a platform-side miss got reported as the customer's configuration — both shipped incidents are that sentence.

1. **A new lister goes through `require_root()`** (`crates/core/src/config/storage.rs`). It turns a missing workspace root into an `Err`. The seven existing listers call it; an eighth that forgets is a silent regression, not a compile error.
2. **Nothing on a manager-construction path may create a directory.** `WorkingCopy::new` once resolved `<root>/.oxy_state` through a resolver that creates what it resolves, so merely building a manager brought the workspace root into existence. That defeated every other guard here, including ones written specifically to catch it — by the time anything stat-ed the root, it was there. Resolve with `oxy_shared::state_dir::state_dir_path`; create only where you write.

`crates/app/tests/platform/walker_storage_divergence.rs` pins both. Full account: `internal-docs/compile-boundary.md` § "Why an absent working copy used to be undiagnosable".

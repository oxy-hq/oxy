//! Keeps [`crate::engine_cache`] the only way to build a `SemanticEngine`.
//!
//! The cache existed before this guard and was used by exactly one call site.
//! Every other surface hand-rolled `spawn_blocking` → `from_semantic_layer` →
//! compile → drop, so the engine build the cache claims is "paid once per
//! workspace per TTL" was in fact paid per request on the surfaces with the
//! biggest layers. Nothing in the type system stops the next handler doing it
//! again. This does.
//!
//! Same shape as `crates/app/tests/compiled_reader_is_not_a_back_door.rs`: a
//! source scan with an allowlist where each entry carries its reason, and where
//! a STALE entry fails too — otherwise the list only grows and stops meaning
//! anything.
//!
//! It lives in this crate rather than `oxy-app/tests/` on purpose: it reads
//! source text and links nothing, so hosting it here costs one more test in a
//! 4-dependency leaf instead of a fresh multi-hundred-MB test binary in
//! `oxy-app` (see the "Build & Test" note in the root `CLAUDE.md`).

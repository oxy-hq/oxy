//! The one door to a compiled [`airlayer::SemanticEngine`].
//!
//! Building an engine revalidates the whole semantic layer and rebuilds the
//! join graph. That cost is worth paying once per workspace, not once per
//! request — but before this module every surface transcribed its own
//! `spawn_blocking` → build → compile → drop dance, and only one of them went
//! through a cache. This is that cache, in the one crate every semantic
//! consumer can already reach.
//!
//! ## Why it lives here
//!
//! `oxy-app-core` already depends on `agentic-semantic`, so an agentic crate
//! importing the cache from `oxy-app-core` is a cargo cycle, not merely a
//! layering violation (`internal-docs/backend-architecture.md`). The door has
//! to sit BELOW every consumer, and `oxy-airlayer-compat` — airlayer + serde +
//! thiserror + uuid — is the deepest crate `oxy-app`, `agentic-semantic`,
//! `agentic-analytics` and `oxy-app-core` all already share.
//!
//! ## What the key has to say
//!
//! [`EngineKey`] is a triple, and each part earned its place by being a way two
//! callers can want *different* engines for the same workspace:
//!
//! - `workspace_id` — the obvious one.
//! - `source` — [`LayerSource`], which names WHERE the layer was read from, not
//!   which revision the request is pinned to. The distinction is the whole
//!   point: a node holding a working copy is `Origin::Compiled` too, so
//!   `ConfigManager::revision_id()` returns `Some(R)` for a handler reading
//!   `semantics_scan_path()` (the working copy) AND for one reading a
//!   materialised tempdir of revision R. Keying on the pinned revision would
//!   collide them — an IDE world-model panel whose working copy is behind the
//!   promoted revision would serve its stale layer to the custom-app data
//!   plane, and vice versa. So callers state their source; they never infer it.
//! - `dialects` — a fingerprint, not the map. `resolve_and_compile` derives
//!   dialects from `config.yml` strings and analytics derives them from live
//!   connectors, so the same layer compiles to different SQL depending on who
//!   asked. An engine built under one map must never be served to the other.
//!
//! ## No lock
//!
//! `SemanticEngine` is `Send + Sync` (asserted below — the earlier cache
//! claimed otherwise and paid for a `Mutex` it did not need). So entries are a
//! bare `Arc<SemanticEngine>`: compiles run concurrently, and there is no guard
//! that a cancelled handler could drop mid-compile.
//!
//! ## Freshness
//!
//! TTL is a safety net. [`SemanticEngineCache::invalidate_workspace`] on every
//! semantic-file write, branch switch, and pull is the primary mechanism — and
//! it clears EVERY key for that workspace, because the writer knows the
//! workspace changed but not which revision/dialect entries that invalidates.
//!
//! ## Bounded
//!
//! Every promote mints a new `revision_id`, so the key space GROWS over a
//! process's life and the explicit invalidations above only ever fire on
//! working-copy routes (they are all IdeOnly). An unbounded map would therefore
//! pin one whole engine per (workspace, revision) a long-lived `oxy serve` or
//! `oxy worker` ever touched. It is an LRU for that reason — the same reason
//! and the same shape as `oxy::config::scan`'s materialised-context cache,
//! which bounds exactly this key space.

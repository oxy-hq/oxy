//! The parsed [`airlayer::SemanticLayer`], cached by the source it was read
//! from.
//!
//! Sibling to [`crate::engine_cache`], and it exists for the same reason one
//! level down. The engine cache keys on [`LayerSource`] so that a working-copy
//! reader and a revision reader can never be handed each other's engine — but
//! an engine is built FROM a layer, and the layer cache underneath it was keyed
//! on `workspace_id` alone. A caller could therefore state
//! `LayerSource::WorkingCopy` honestly, be handed a *compiled* layer by the
//! cache below, and file the resulting engine under a source it was not built
//! from. Keying both caches the same way is what makes the engine cache's key
//! mean what it says.
//!
//! ## The collision this closes
//!
//! One workspace has TWO semantic scan roots, and on an `ide` or `all` node
//! both are read in the same process against one map:
//!
//! * the **working copy** — what is checked out, uncommitted edits included.
//!   The world-model handlers scan it directly
//!   (`config_manager.semantics_scan_path()`).
//! * the **compile boundary** — the promoted, immutable revision materialised
//!   out of Postgres, which `/semantic`, metric-tree and preagg reach through
//!   `semantic::resolve_query_scan_source`.
//!
//! They differ whenever the promoted revision isn't what's on disk: a feature
//! branch, uncommitted edits, a protected-`main` redirect. Keyed on
//! `workspace_id` alone, whichever family populated the entry first decided
//! what the other saw until the TTL lapsed — a compile-boundary reader
//! executing queries against a working copy, or an IDE user shown `main`
//! instead of the branch they are editing.
//!
//! ## Why the key cannot be the pinned revision
//!
//! Same trap as the engine cache: a node holding a working copy is
//! `Origin::Compiled` too, so `ConfigManager::revision_id()` answers `Some(R)`
//! for a handler reading `semantics_scan_path()` AND for one reading a
//! materialised tempdir of revision R. Callers state their source; they never
//! infer it. `ScanDir::is_materialised()` is what makes that answerable, and
//! `QueryScanSource::source_revision()` is where the query handlers get it.
//!
//! ## Freshness and size
//!
//! TTL is a safety net; [`SemanticLayerCache::invalidate_workspace`] on every
//! semantic-file write, branch switch and pull is the primary mechanism, and it
//! clears every key for the workspace because the writer knows the workspace
//! changed but not which of its sources that invalidates.
//!
//! Bounded for the reason naming the revision creates: every promote mints a
//! new `revision_id`, the explicit invalidations above are all IdeOnly
//! working-copy routes, and expiry is lazy — so a retired revision's entry is
//! never looked up again and an unbounded map would pin one parsed layer per
//! (workspace, revision) a long-lived `oxy serve` ever touched. An LRU bounds
//! it, exactly as in `engine_cache` and `oxy::config::scan`.
//!
//! Note there is deliberately no eager sweep of a workspace's superseded
//! revisions on insert: across a promote window requests pinned to the old and
//! the new revision are both in flight, so evicting one on the other's insert
//! ping-pongs expensive reloads. See `engine_cache::get_or_build`.

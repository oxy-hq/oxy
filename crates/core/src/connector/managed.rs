//! Port for resolving *managed* databases (`airhouse_managed`,
//! `postgres_managed`) to a ready-to-connect Postgres DSN.
//!
//! The resolution itself — minting an ephemeral airhouse credential through
//! the SA-backed broker, or looking up a per-org OLTP analyst connection —
//! needs the `airhouse` / `oxy-oltp` vendor crates, which are an
//! Integration-&-infra concern, not a platform-core one. Keeping those out of
//! `oxy` core means core must not call them directly. Instead it defines this
//! trait and reads an implementation that the application layer (`oxy-app`,
//! which owns those crates) registers once at startup — the same shape as
//! [`oxy_observability::global`].
//!
//! Core still owns the *shape* of a managed connection: it wraps the resolved
//! DSN in a [`crate::connector`] `ConnectorX` (Postgres wire). The port
//! supplies only the DSN string — the one piece that needs the vendor crates.

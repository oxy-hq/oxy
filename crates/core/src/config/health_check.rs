//! Per-workspace health-check cadence, configured in `config.yml` under
//! `health_check:`. The cadence drives the workspace's `health_eval` schedule
//! row (see `agentic_pipeline::scheduler::reconcile_health_schedule`); the eval
//! itself runs as a `TaskSpec::Custom { kind: "health_eval_workspace" }` on the
//! global-run fleet. Operator-facing notes — who gets evaluated, and what else
//! rides inside the eval pass — live in `internal-docs/admin-surfaces.md`
//! ("Workspace health → who actually gets evaluated").
//!
//! **Health checks are off until a workspace asks for them.** Writing a
//! `health_check:` block is the opt-in; a workspace with no block runs no eval
//! at all. See [`resolve_enabled`] — that function, not the `enabled` field's
//! serde default, is the policy, because the two answer different questions:
//! the field default covers "block written, `enabled:` omitted" (→ on), while
//! `resolve_enabled` covers "no block at all" (→ off).

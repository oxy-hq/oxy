/// resolved per source kind on every run.
///
/// # Singleton
///
/// One row, id `1`. Enforced in the schema by
/// `id SMALLINT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1 CHECK (id = 1)`, not by convention here
/// — see `migration::m20260807_000001_airway_deployment_config`. Read it with
/// [`Entity::find_by_id`]`(1)` and write it with an upsert on `id`; nothing
/// should ever `find().all()` this table.
///
/// # NULL means airway's default, never zero
///
/// Every setting is `Option`, and `None` maps to `None` on the matching
/// `GlobalConfig` field, which `apply_to_http` / `apply_to_retry` treat as
/// "leave the compiled-in value alone". A stored `0` is a value the operator
/// chose, and airway rejects it for all four durations. Do not `unwrap_or(0)`
/// anything here, and do not introduce an Oxy-side default constant — that
/// would silently diverge from upstream's the first time airway changed a
/// built-in.
///
/// # `tls` is one setting over four columns
///
/// `GlobalConfig::tls` is an `Option<TlsConfig>`, and airway spells its inputs
/// as four flat keys. The mapping in
/// `agentic_airway::deployment_config::DeploymentValues` is what decides
/// whether the four columns amount to a configured trust store at all
/// (`TlsConfig::carries_settings`) — notably, `tls_danger_accept_invalid_certs
/// = false` alone does not. `tls_server_name` / `tls_enabled` have no column
/// because airway offers no key for them.
///
/// # Column names are airway's key spellings
///
/// Including the unit suffix (`_secs`, `_ms`). `agentic-airway` may not depend
/// on this crate (see `crates/agentic/airway/CLAUDE.md`), so it reads the
/// table through a hand-written `SELECT` over
/// `agentic_airway::deployment_config::COLUMNS`; the two lists are pinned
/// against each other by `entity_columns_match_the_airway_key_roster` in
/// `crates/app/src/server/api/admin/airway_config/deployment_tests.rs`.

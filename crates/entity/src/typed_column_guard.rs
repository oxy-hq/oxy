//! Enforces the rule stated at the crate root: a struct deriving
//! `DeriveEntityModel` also carries `#[sea_orm::model]`.
//!
//! The crate-root docs describe the failure mode — the attribute is what emits
//! `COLUMN`, so omitting it loses the typed form *while still compiling*, and
//! the mistake surfaces later at an unrelated call site that cannot resolve
//! `COLUMN`. A convention whose failure mode is "still compiles" cannot be left
//! to review attention; this is the mechanical guard for it.
//!
//! The scan is workspace-wide rather than crate-local on purpose. Sea-ORM
//! entities live in seven other crates, and a `crates/entity`-only check would
//! report all-clear while someone in `crates/cameras` hits an unresolvable
//! `COLUMN` with no way to tell whether that is deliberate.
//!
//! `PENDING` is a backlog, not an exemption list. Those entities predate the
//! attribute and are listed so the guard can fail on *new* omissions today
//! rather than waiting for the backlog to clear. Removing an entry — by adding
//! the attribute — is always the right direction; adding one needs a reason.

//! An enrolled kiosk — the device a frontline PIN may be entered on.
//!
//! Two lifetimes in one row. Before binding, `enrol_token_hash` and
//! `enrol_expires_at` hold a one-time link an org admin hands to the tablet;
//! after, `secret_hash` holds the long-lived credential the browser carries in
//! the `oxy_kiosk` cookie and the token columns are NULL. `revoked_at` is how a
//! lost tablet is switched off; the row stays, because which kiosk a shift was
//! signed in on is part of the audit trail. See the migration and
//! `internal-docs/frontline-identity.md`.

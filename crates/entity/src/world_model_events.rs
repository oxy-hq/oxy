//! `world_model_events` — the durable, cross-pod carrier for the world-model
//! live feed (order ripples, camera transitions, compliance reports).
//!
//! The in-process broadcast bus in `world_model.rs` is per-pod, so a webhook
//! landing on a `serve` replica never reached a viewer whose SSE connection
//! lives on the ide. Publishers now append a row here; every pod tails the
//! table by `id` and fans each row out onto its own local bus.
//!
//! Being a table rather than a notification channel buys three things at once:
//! cross-pod fan-out, history for a viewer that connects mid-shift, and a
//! countable `orders/min` (a stream can't be counted — reconnects lose events).
//!
//! Rows are disposable: a reaper trims anything past the retention window.

/// Index for the anomaly inbox's page-count query.
///
/// The inbox pages **events**, not rows, so its `total` is
/// `COUNT(DISTINCT COALESCE(event_id, id))` filtered by workspace and status.
/// `idx_metric_anomalies_workspace_status_detected` narrows the rows, but the
/// distinct is over an expression, so Postgres still had to read every matching
/// row and aggregate. That count runs on every list request once a workspace
/// holds more than one page of anomalies — including the Semantic Layer tab
/// badge, which mounts whether or not anyone opens the inbox, and re-runs after
/// each scan poll and each Ack.
///
/// Indexing the expression itself lets the same query run index-only.
/// `COALESCE` over two immutable columns is immutable, so it is indexable.
///
/// Raw SQL because sea-orm's schema builder has no expression-index form.
///
/// **Locking, deliberately.** This is a plain `CREATE INDEX`, so it holds a
/// `SHARE` lock on `metric_anomalies` for the duration of the build: reads keep
/// working, but every write blocks — scan upserts and status changes alike. `CONCURRENTLY` is not an
/// option here: sea-orm wraps each migration in a transaction and Postgres
/// refuses concurrent index builds inside one. The call to take the lock anyway
/// rests on the table's size, not on hope — `metric_anomalies` holds one row per
/// flagged bucket per monitored segment, upserted rather than appended, so it
/// grows with monitor count and history, not with traffic. That is a table in
/// the thousands-to-low-millions, where this build is seconds at the outside,
/// and it happens once during a deploy's migration step — a window in which the
/// inbox still serves and only writes wait.
///
/// Two caveats on that estimate, since it is the whole basis for taking the
/// lock. It has **no retention**: nothing prunes resolved anomalies, so the
/// bound is monitors × segments × history, and history only grows. And a single
/// long-running regime shift is one event with an unbounded bucket count (which
/// is why the *read* path caps buckets per event). Neither breaks the estimate
/// on a workspace of ordinary age, but both mean "thousands-to-low-millions" is
/// a claim to re-check on a mature tenant rather than a property of the schema.
/// The migration logs its own row estimate before building, so the number is in
/// the deploy log rather than something to go looking for afterwards. If that ever stops
/// being true, the move is a separate out-of-band `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
/// and an empty migration here — not a silent downgrade to no index, which puts
/// a full aggregate back on the inbox's page-count query.
///
/// That escape hatch needs no code change, which is the point of `IF NOT
/// EXISTS`: an operator who knows their `metric_anomalies` is large can build
/// the index out of band *before* deploying, and this migration then finds it
/// and does nothing.
///
/// ```sql
/// CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_metric_anomalies_ws_status_event_key
///   ON metric_anomalies (workspace_id, status, (COALESCE(event_id, id)));
/// ```

//! Shared-database migration ordering for integration test fixtures.
//!
//! `agentic-pipeline`, `agentic-runtime`, and `agentic-airway` integration
//! tests all run against **one** Postgres database: CI points every test
//! binary's `OXY_DATABASE_URL` at the same instance, and locally the
//! testcontainer fixtures reuse a single container via
//! `ReuseDirective::Always`. Each test binary is its own process, and
//! nextest gives no ordering guarantee between binaries — so whichever
//! fixture's `test_db()` reaches the shared database first is the one that
//! actually creates the schema for everyone else.
//!
//! # Why central must run first
//!
//! Production always runs the central migrator (`crates/migration`) before
//! the agentic-runtime migrator (see `cli/commands/serve.rs`, `airway.rs`,
//! `admin.rs`), so `agentic_runtime::migration` is written defensively to
//! tolerate running *second*. The clearest evidence is in
//! `RationalizeStatusModel` (`crates/agentic/runtime/src/migration.rs`):
//!
//! ```text
//! // Ensure thread_id column exists (may have been added by central migrator
//! // or may be missing in test databases that only run runtime migrations).
//! if !column_exists(manager, "agentic_runs", "thread_id").await? {
//!     db.execute_unprepared("ALTER TABLE agentic_runs ADD COLUMN thread_id UUID").await?;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Central's equivalent migrations (`m20260318_000001_add_thread_id_to_agentic_runs`,
//! `m20260401_000001_add_spec_hint_to_agentic_runs`,
//! `m20260402_000001_add_thinking_mode_to_agentic_runs`) do **not** carry that
//! guard, because production never needs it — central always leads. If a test
//! fixture runs `RuntimeMigrator::up` alone and happens to reach the shared DB
//! first, central then arrives second and fails outright: `42701 column
//! "thread_id" of relation "agentic_runs" already exists`, or `42P07` on an
//! index central creates without `.if_not_exists()`. This is exactly the
//! non-determinism this helper exists to remove.
//!
//! # The fix, and why the migrators are injected
//!
//! Every fixture on the shared database migrates in the same order production
//! does: central, then runtime, then (optionally) a domain migrator. Whichever
//! binary gets there first leaves the DB correctly migrated; every other binary
//! finds everything already applied and its migration calls no-op through.
//!
//! **The order is carried by the types, not by the caller.** [`migrate_shared_test_db`]
//! hard-codes central and takes the runtime migrator as a type parameter; it
//! returns a [`DomainMigrations`] token, and a domain migrator can *only* be
//! run through that token. There is no way to obtain one without having already
//! run central-then-runtime, so a fixture cannot get the order wrong by
//! accident — which is the property, and the reason this lives in one helper
//! instead of three copy-pasted lines per fixture:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! oxy_test_utils::migration::migrate_shared_test_db::<RuntimeMigrator>(&url, &db)
//!     .await
//!     .expect("shared migrations")
//!     .then::<AirwayMigrator>()
//!     .await
//!     .expect("airway migrations")
//!     .finish()
//!     .await;
//! ```
//!
//! Injecting the migrators rather than naming them is also what keeps this
//! crate's dependency direction right. `oxy-test-utils` is a shared *platform*
//! test crate — `oxy` and `oxy-app` dev-depend on it too — and platform crates
//! must never depend on an `agentic-*` crate (`internal-docs/backend-architecture.md`,
//! "Platform → Agentic: NEVER"). Naming `RuntimeMigrator` here would have put
//! the whole agentic tree behind every `cargo nextest run -p oxy` and made this
//! crate unusable anywhere that doesn't want it. Generic parameters cost
//! nothing at the call site — every fixture that passes `RuntimeMigrator`
//! already depends on `agentic-runtime` — and cost this crate no dependency at
//! all.
//!
//! # Ordering is not enough — the sequence has to be serialized
//!
//! Ordering *within* a fixture does not order the fixtures against **each
//! other**, and that was the remaining half of the bug. Against a database
//! that already has the schema, every one of these calls is a no-op and the
//! races are invisible. Against a **fresh** one, several binaries run
//! `migration::Migrator::up` at the same moment and central's migrations are
//! not idempotent, so the losers die on the DDL the winner already ran:
//!
//! ```text
//! 42P07  relation "idx_agentic_run_events_run_id_seq" already exists
//! 42701  column "thread_id" of relation "agentic_runs" already exists
//! ```
//!
//! Making each colliding migration idempotent is whack-a-mole on *shipped*
//! migrations — patching the index above just moved the failure to the next
//! one. So the whole sequence runs under a Postgres **advisory lock**
//! ([`SHARED_TEST_DB_MIGRATION_LOCK_KEY`]), which serializes across processes
//! however many there are: the first binary migrates, the rest block, and each
//! then finds everything applied. This is the same mechanism, for the same
//! reason, as `oxy-app`'s `server::test_support` and `oxy serve`'s boot
//! migration (`cli/commands/serve.rs`) — concurrent `Migrator::up` against one
//! database is never safe, in tests or in the fleet.
//!
//! The lock covers the domain migrators too, not just central + runtime: it is
//! released by [`DomainMigrations::finish`] (or, if a fixture forgets, when the
//! token drops), so the entire central → runtime → domain sequence is one
//! critical section.
//!
//! Two things about the failure mode are worth keeping, because they make it
//! look worse than a race usually does:
//!
//! - **On Postgres, sea-orm wraps a whole `Migrator::up` in ONE transaction**
//!   (`exec_with_connection` in `sea-orm-migration`), install of the
//!   `seaql_migrations` table included. A failure on the last pending migration
//!   therefore rolls back *everything*, so a poisoned database shows no
//!   `seaql_migrations` table at all — not a partially-applied one.
//! - **It does not heal.** A fixture that runs `RuntimeMigrator::up` *without*
//!   central creates `agentic_runs` already carrying `thread_id`, and every
//!   central run afterwards dies on `42701` forever — every test in every
//!   binary, not just the one that lost a race. `pipeline_lease_test` was
//!   exactly that fixture and cost 174 of 432 tests on a fresh database; it now
//!   goes through this helper like everything else. **A lock cannot save a
//!   fixture that opts out of it** — if you add a fixture on the shared
//!   database, migrate through here.
//!
//! One gap this does not close: `oxy-app`'s `server::test_support` bootstrap
//! migrates the same database under a *different* key, and its `kind(lib)`
//! tests are not in the `serial-db` group, so a whole-workspace run against a
//! fresh database can still overlap the two families. That is the one race the
//! surviving `.if_not_exists()` guards in `crates/migration` still earn their
//! keep on; closing it means giving both bootstraps one key.

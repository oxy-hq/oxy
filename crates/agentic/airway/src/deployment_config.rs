//! The **deployment (operational) tier**: airway's process-wide
//! [`GlobalConfig`], sourced from the singleton `airway_deployment_config` row
//! and installed exactly once per process.
//!
//! Distinct from the **policy tier** ([`crate::AirwayAdmission`], from
//! `airway_source_config`), which is per source kind, resolved per run, and
//! passed explicitly into `Source::try_from_connector_with`. This tier is
//! per *process*: airway keeps it in a `OnceLock` that `HttpConfig::default`
//! and `RetryConfig::default` read, which is what lets it reach transports
//! nobody remembered to plumb.
//!
//! **Two kinds of reader, since 0.1.24.** The seven original settings are read
//! by those two `Default` impls, so they reach a transport by being *built*.
//! `cursor_lag_floor_secs` is read by `global::resolve_cursor_lookback`, which
//! a source calls per resource while deciding how far back to pull. That is a
//! different reach — a source with no incremental cursor never asks — and it
//! is why the roster below says "every airway load" rather than "every HTTP
//! client".
//!
//! # Three properties shape everything here
//!
//! 1. **`install` is one-shot.** A second call returns `Err`, and airway is
//!    explicit that quietly keeping the first would leave a caller looking at
//!    settings that never took effect. So a change to the row needs a process
//!    restart, and the admin surface has to *say* so rather than implying a
//!    save is live.
//! 2. **Absence is not zero.** A NULL column is `None` on the matching
//!    `GlobalConfig` field, and `apply_to_http` / `apply_to_retry` are
//!    gap-fillers — `None` leaves airway's own compiled-in constant in place.
//!    There is no Oxy-side default constant in this module, deliberately: one
//!    would drift from upstream's the moment airway changed a built-in.
//! 3. **Parsing and validation are airway's, not ours.** [`DeploymentValues`]
//!    renders itself as the flat string keys airway already reads and hands
//!    them to [`GlobalConfig::from_lookup`], which parses *and* calls
//!    `GlobalConfig::validate`. Every rule — zero durations (including a zero
//!    `cursor_lag_floor_secs`, refused because `max(lag, 0)` raises nothing and
//!    so is indistinguishable from omitting the key), an empty `user_agent`, a
//!    `user_agent` that cannot become a header, a backoff factor below 1, half
//!    an mTLS identity, a TLS struct that carries settings it would drop —
//!    arrives for free and stays in one place. A second copy on the oxy side
//!    is a copy that goes stale. The *warning* above an implausibly large
//!    floor (~30 days) is upstream's too, and is deliberately not restated:
//!    it is a caution rather than a refusal, and duplicating it would double
//!    the line an operator sees.
//!
//! # Where this tier reaches
//!
//! Stated as a roster rather than a claim, the way airway states its own —
//! "has a reader" is not "reaches every client".
//!
//! [`install_once`] runs at **process boot**, from `oxy-app`'s
//! `airway_boot::install_deployment_tier`, wired into each of the three entry
//! points that can build a source connector (`oxy serve` — and so `oxy start`
//! — under every `OXY_ROLE`; `oxy worker`; `oxy airway`). That is what makes
//! the roster below reach everything: the tier is a *process-wide* `OnceLock`,
//! so one install covers every connector the process builds, with no
//! signature to thread and nothing to remember at a new call site.
//!
//! The `cursor_lag_floor_secs` column of the table is not "reached" but
//! "consumed": every site below installs the whole tier, and the floor is the
//! one setting that only *some* of them can act on, since only an extract asks
//! `resolve_cursor_lookback` anything.
//!
//! | site | reached | consumes the cursor floor |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `worker::run_pipeline` — every airway load: HTTP, schedule, `oxy airway run`, automation step, backfill | yes. It also still **calls** [`install_once`] itself — see below | yes — this is the only site that extracts |
//! | `agentic_pipeline::airway_run::discover_airway_source_tables` (`POST /sources/discover`, the create-pipeline wizard's table picker) | yes, via the boot install. This one does connect to the vendor, and before the hoist it ran on airway's built-in timeout, retry and TLS — an operator's custom CA bundle worked for runs and not for the wizard, which reads as a broken source rather than a config gap | no — it lists tables, it never pulls rows against a cursor |
//! | `oxy-app`'s admin policy preview (`airway_config::preview`) | yes, via the boot install — though it needs nothing: it builds a connector only to read `contracts()` and makes no request at all | no, for the same reason it needs nothing else |
//! | any connector site added later inside an oxy-app process | yes, by construction | only if it extracts |
//! | a process with no database (`oxy run`, which falls back to no-op storage) | no, and correctly: there is no row to read, so airway's own compiled-in settings stay in force | n/a |
//!
//! One place the floor deliberately does **not** show up: [`crate::contract`]'s
//! `ResourceContract`, the per-resource projection the run UI renders. That
//! reports the *declared* contract — a vendor claim — and the floor is a
//! deployment position layered over it at extract time. Folding
//! `max(cursor_lag, floor)` in there by hand would be the second copy of an
//! upstream rule this module exists to avoid, and it would silently restate an
//! operator's setting as something the vendor said.
//!
//! **`run_pipeline` keeps its call**, and it is not a redundant second
//! install. It is the fallback for any process with no oxy-app boot seam — an
//! integration test, a future binary, an embedder of this crate — and it is
//! where a malformed row is *raised* rather than logged: boot must not refuse
//! to start a serve replica over a setting most of it never touches, so it
//! warns, and the `OnceCell` (which does not cache an `Err`) leaves the next
//! run to re-read the row and fail onto the operator's SSE stream. After a
//! successful boot install the second call short-circuits without running its
//! closure, so it logs nothing and costs one `OnceCell` read.
//!
//! Run this to find any new connector site:
//!
//! ```text
//! grep -rn 'build_source_connector\|discover_source_tables' crates/ --include='*.rs'
//! ```
//!
//! # Why a hand-written `SELECT`
//!
//! `crates/agentic/airway/CLAUDE.md` bars this crate from depending on
//! `entity`. The row's read-side type therefore lives in `entity` for the
//! admin API and is *not* reachable here, so [`load`] issues its own query
//! over [`COLUMNS`]. Those column names are airway's own key spellings, and
//! the two lists are pinned against each other by
//! `entity_columns_match_the_airway_key_roster` in `oxy-app`, which can see
//! both crates.

///   value to lose). An old replica's save leaves `cursor_lag_floor_secs`
///   exactly as it found it. Pinned by

///   statement a pre-#111 build would emit. Note this is a property of that one
///   call site, not of the type: a refactor to `Entity::update` — SeaORM writes
///   every column in the model — would reintroduce it for the *next* field
///   added here, which is what that test exists to catch.
/// * **An older *client* body against a current process does clear it, by
///   design.** The endpoint is a replace, not a patch, and `#[serde(default)]`
///   below is what makes that work: a missing key deserializes to `None`, which
///   is how the UI clears a setting back to airway's built-in default. A
///   browser tab holding a pre-deploy bundle posts the ten fields it knows and
///   so clears the eleventh. That is the same behaviour as clearing any other

/// Called at **process boot** by `oxy-app`'s `airway_boot`, and again from
/// `run_pipeline` immediately before the first source is built — the second
/// call is the fallback for a process with no oxy-app boot seam, and a no-op
/// once boot has succeeded. See the module doc for the split, and `worker.rs`
/// for why `run_pipeline` is that crate's seam and `AirwayWorker::new` is not.
///
/// # No row is still an install
///
/// An absent row installs an all-`None` [`GlobalConfig`], which behaves
/// identically to not installing at all (every `apply_to_*` is a gap-filler).
/// It is done anyway so that `installed()` returning `Some` is a reliable
/// signal that *this process has resolved its tier* — otherwise the admin
/// surface could not tell "running airway's defaults" from "this replica never
/// resolved the row at all", and those need different words.
///
/// # A malformed row is an `Err`, and the caller decides how loud that is
///
/// Rather than falling back to defaults. That is airway's own rule for this
/// tier and it is the right one: a silent fallback means the operator sets a
/// timeout, sees the old one, and has nothing to read. The write path
/// validates through the same [`DeploymentValues::to_global`], so a row that
/// fails here was written around the API.
///
/// The two callers make different, deliberate choices with that `Err`: boot
/// logs it and starts anyway (a serve replica must not refuse to come up over
/// a setting most of it never touches), `run_pipeline` fails the run with it
/// (where it reaches the operator on the SSE stream). Both are reachable
/// because `get_or_try_init` does **not** cache an `Err` — a row still broken
/// at run time is re-read and re-raised, and one fixed between boot and the
/// run is simply picked up.
///
/// # A second installer is reported, not raised
///
/// `validate` runs first, so a failure from airway's `install` after that can
/// only mean something else in this process installed first. That is not the
/// operator's mistake and must not fail their run — but it does mean these
/// values are not in force, so it is logged at `warn` with exactly that
/// wording.

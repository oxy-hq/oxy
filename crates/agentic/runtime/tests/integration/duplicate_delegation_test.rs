//! A task that is already waiting on children must never spawn a second set.
//!
//! Regression cover for the bug where one `type: airway` step in a workflow
//! produced up to three concurrent executions of the same pipeline. The chain:
//! a delegating step suspends, `DurableTransport` deliberately writes nothing
//! (the row must stay `claimed` so it can resume) — but suspending also
//! completes the driver future, which cancelled the heartbeat ticker and froze
//! `last_heartbeat`. The reaper read that as a dead worker and re-queued the
//! task at the visibility timeout; a worker re-claimed it, the decider re-ran,
//! the child still hadn't answered, and it delegated the SAME step again. Up to
//! `max_claims` copies, then dead-lettered.
//!
//! The ticker half is fixed in `Worker::handle_task` and covered by
//! `heartbeat_lifetime_tests` there — a unit test, because shrinking
//! `visibility_timeout_secs` below the 15s heartbeat interval to make an
//! end-to-end version fast would just make the reaper win for an unrelated
//! reason.
//!
//! This is the second half: even if something *does* re-drive a suspended
//! coordinator (crash recovery re-running a decider, a future re-claim path),
//! the coordinator must recognise the re-delegation and drop it rather than
//! minting another `{task_id}.{n}`.
//!
//! Run:
//!   cargo nextest run -p agentic-runtime --test integration -E 'test(duplicate_delegation_test)'

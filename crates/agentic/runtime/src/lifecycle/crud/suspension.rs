///
/// The timestamp exists because the coordinator's suspend timeout is measured
/// from a `tokio::time::Instant`, which does not survive a process restart;
/// `from_db` would otherwise hand every recovered task a fresh full timeout.
/// This is the persisted, absolute counterpart, so a task already suspended for
/// three hours resumes with one hour left rather than four.
///
/// `None` means the run has no suspension row at all — never suspended, or
/// already resumed and cleaned up.
///
/// **The timestamp does not depend on the checkpoint parsing.** They are
/// returned as `(started, Option<data>)` rather than being collapsed into one
/// `Option`, because a `resume_data` that fails to deserialize must not take
/// `created_at` down with it. `SuspendedRunData` derives a plain `Deserialize`
/// with no field defaults, so adding a required field makes every pre-deploy
/// row unparseable — and recovery onto a new binary is exactly when
/// `Coordinator::from_db` runs. Such a task cannot resume either way, so it
/// should reach the suspend ceiling promptly; losing the timestamp would
/// instead hand it a fresh full timeout on every recovery, which under a deploy
/// cadence shorter than the ceiling means never.

//! Task router: wakes idle workers when new tasks are enqueued.
//!
//! Two concrete implementations live alongside this trait:
//! - [`PostgresTaskRouter`]: production. Holds a dedicated `LISTEN
//!   oxy_task_enqueued` connection and translates Postgres notifications
//!   into a local `Notify`. Cross-process wake is "for free" because the
//!   notification fans out to every instance with an active listener.
//! - [`NoopTaskRouter`]: tests + CLI paths that don't run a long-lived
//!   process. `wait_for_task` falls through to the caller's backstop
//!   timeout; `notify_enqueued` is a no-op. Workers still work, just
//!   without the latency optimization.
//!
//! ## Why the trait
//!
//! The router is the one place in the runtime that's Postgres-specific
//! (LISTEN/NOTIFY is a vendor extension). Keeping it behind a trait means
//! the rest of the codebase — the worker claim loop, the enqueue helper,
//! the coordinator — talks to a single abstraction. If we ever swap to a
//! different durable store, only the impl needs to move; everything else
//! is unaware of the wake mechanism.
//!
//! The trait is also the natural extension point for worker classes (see
//! `OXY_WORKER_MAX_INFLIGHT` doc in `worker.rs`): `wait_for_task` already
//! takes a class filter, even though today's single-channel impl ignores
//! it. Per-class channels drop in by changing only the impl.
//!
//! ## What the router is NOT
//!
//! - Not a scheduler. The DB queue + `SKIP LOCKED` is the scheduler.
//! - Not a coordinator. Coordinators still own their task trees in
//!   memory; the router just helps their workers wake faster.
//! - Not a reaper. Stale-claim recovery is a sibling background job
//!   (see `background.rs`); see `crud::reap_stale_tasks`. Different
//!   responsibility, different cadence.

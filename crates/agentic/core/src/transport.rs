//! Transport traits for the coordinator-worker architecture.
//!
//! The coordinator publishes [`TaskAssignment`]s and receives
//! [`WorkerMessage`]s. Workers pull assignments and send messages back.
//! The transport layer is swappable: in-process channels for day 1,
//! gRPC or message queues for distributed deployment later.

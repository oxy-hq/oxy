# agentic-http

Axum HTTP routes for the agentic pipeline. This is the **transport layer** — thin handlers that map HTTP requests to `agentic-pipeline` and `agentic-runtime` operations.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Handler | Description |
| -------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| POST | `/runs` | `create_run` | Start a pipeline (analytics or builder) |
| GET | `/runs/:id/events` | `stream_events` | SSE stream with Last-Event-ID catch-up |
| POST | `/runs/:id/answer` | `answer_run` | Deliver HITL answer to suspended run |
| POST | `/runs/:id/cancel` | `cancel_run` | Cancel running pipeline |
| PATCH | `/runs/:id/thinking_mode` | `update_thinking_mode` | Update thinking mode on completed run |
| GET | `/threads/:thread_id/run` | `get_run_by_thread` | Latest run for a thread |
| GET | `/threads/:thread_id/runs` | `list_runs_by_thread` | All runs for a thread |

## Dependencies

```
agentic-http depends on:
  agentic-pipeline  (facade — the ONLY domain entry point)
  agentic-runtime   (CRUD/state — domain-agnostic)
  oxy-auth          (AuthenticatedUserExtractor — the only oxy-* import)
```

**Zero `oxy::*` imports.** The host app opens its SeaORM `DatabaseConnection`
once at startup and passes it to `AgenticState::new`. Per-request workspace
state arrives as `Extension<Arc<agentic_pipeline::platform::OxyProjectContext>>`
from the app's `workspace_middleware`.

**Zero direct imports of:** analytics, builder, connector, llm, core, entity, workflow.

## Rules

- **Never import domain crates directly.** All domain access goes through `agentic-pipeline`.
- **Never import `oxy::*`.** Host-project state comes via `Extension<Arc<OxyProjectContext>>`;
  the DB connection lives on `AgenticState::db`.
- **Never import `entity` crate.** Thread ownership queries go through `agentic-pipeline::get_thread_owner`.
- `db.rs` is pure re-exports from runtime + pipeline — no custom logic.
- `sse.rs` is domain-agnostic — `UiEvent`, `squash_deltas`, `is_terminal` only.
- `state.rs` uses `agentic_pipeline::AnalyticsSchemaCatalog` and `BuilderTestRunnerTrait` re-exports.
- `routes.rs` uses `PipelineBuilder` for all pipeline creation — no inline config/solver setup.

## State Management

`AgenticState` wraps `RuntimeState` (via `Deref`) and adds:

- `db` — shared SeaORM `DatabaseConnection` (pool internally), cloned per handler
- `schema_cache` — shared analytics schema introspection cache
- `builder_test_runner` — injected test runner for builder copilot
- `event_registry` — domain event processors for SSE streaming

## SSE Streaming

`stream_events` uses the `EventRegistry` from state to process raw DB rows into frontend events. The registry picks the right domain processor based on the run's `source_type`. No domain event types are imported — the registry handles deserialization internally via registered `RowProcessor` closures.

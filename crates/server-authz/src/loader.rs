//! Turn a `(user_id, email)` into [`PrincipalFacts`] — the org sets, partner standings
//! and global flags [`oxy_authz::allows`] decides over. This is consolidation, not a new
//! authority; every fact comes from an existing primitive:
//!
//! * org roles    → one `org_members` query, with owner/admin/member derived from the
//!   rows in memory ([`derive_org_roles`])
//! * partner sets → bounded queries over active grants + partner access + managed
//!   clients, and their ceilings — straight from `partner_authz::operated_partners` /
//!   `assumed_partners`, the single source `resolve_scope` also reads. This once
//!   hand-rolled those queries under a "keep the two in sync" comment, which was the
//!   drift it exists to prevent; there is one implementation now.
//! * ws overrides → one `workspace_members` query, only the exceptional elevations
//! * global admin → [`is_app_admin_email`] (`app_admins` table)
//! * global owner → [`is_oxy_owner`] (`OXY_OWNER` env allow-list)
//!
//! Cost (design §5): the guards call this at most ONCE per request — `authz::
//! request_facts` memoizes it in the request's extensions. The partner queries
//! short-circuit to empty for the common non-partner user, so a typical request is
//! three queries: memberships + ws-overrides + app-admins.

/// Load the authorization-relevant facts for a principal. `None` means **"we don't
/// know"** — a lookup errored — and is deliberately not the same value as `Some(facts)`
/// with empty sets, which means "we asked, and this principal belongs to nothing".
///
/// ## Why this returns an Option
///
/// This used to collapse a failed query to an empty set and call that "fail closed,
/// so the worst case is more denial". That reasoning is right in isolation and wrong
/// here. Under `enforce`, empty sets are read as *facts*: the model concludes the
/// principal is in no org, denies, and `existing_allow && false` turns a transient blip
/// — a statement timeout, a serialization failure, a dropped socket — into a **403 for
/// a legitimate org officer on every guarded route** until it clears.
///
/// It also quietly broke the promise `server::authz` makes: "a database blip must not
/// lock every tenant out of their org". That fail-safe only ever covered a failure to
/// *establish* a connection (`request_facts` → `None`); a connection that is up but
/// errors on one lookup sailed straight past it and denied.
///
/// So the failure is surfaced instead of averaged into the data, and each caller says
/// what unknown means for it. There is no safe blanket answer: an `enforce` caller can
/// defer to `existing_allow` (the conjunction only ever subtracts, so deferring cannot
/// open a hole), but a caller reading `allows` with no legacy term beside it must treat
/// unknown as **deny** — see `thread.rs`, where unknown standing must never confer
/// operator reach.

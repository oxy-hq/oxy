//! Axum HTTP routes for the camera fleet domain.
//!
//! Two subtrees, two mounting points:
//!
//! - **Edge tree** ([`router`]) — `/control/*` routes that the Python
//!   edge worker calls. The device-token middleware verifies a
//!   per-device JWT (signed with the device's HMAC secret from
//!   `device_registry`), resolves the active `device_claims` row, and
//!   injects the [`EdgeContext`](crate::auth::EdgeContext) (with
//!   `workspace_id`) into request extensions. Mounted at the *root* of
//!   the app router because edge boxes don't know their workspace_id
//!   — the JWT alone identifies them.
//!
//! - **Operator workspace tree** ([`workspace_routes`]) — user-facing
//!   endpoints for managing sites / cameras / edge boxes / UniFi
//!   onboarding. Mounted by the app crate *under
//!   `/{workspace_id}/...`* alongside the rest of
//!   `build_workspace_routes`, which puts them behind the standard
//!   user-session + workspace-context middleware. Service-layer fns
//!   double-check that any referenced resource (site, camera) belongs
//!   to the URL's workspace_id — protects against a caller in
//!   workspace A guessing a `site_id` from workspace B.

//! Staff-facing Airhouse fleet, for the admin console.
//!
//! The member-facing `/airhouse/me/*` routes answer "what is MY workspace's
//! warehouse". This answers the operator's question instead: which workspaces
//! have one, which do not, and is anything wrong with the ones that do.
//!
//! **Workspace-keyed, not org-keyed** — an Airhouse tenant is one per
//! workspace, not one per org. That is why the scope fence on the
//! `oxy-app` side uses `deny_out_of_scope_opt`: a workspace's org is nullable,
//! and a null org must refuse for a bounded grant rather than pass unchecked.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no `router()` here**: the routes are
//! declared by `oxy_app::server::api::admin::airhouse`, which fences each one
//! before delegating. The capability layer at the mount decides *whether you
//! are staff*; only a handler can decide *which orgs you reach*.

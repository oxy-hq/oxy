//! The `availability` field on the `/customer-apps` list rows: the same
//! reading `GET /customer-apps/{org}/{app}/availability` answers with, so the
//! console takes it from the list instead of asking once per app.
//!
//! ## One function builds both
//!
//! [`AvailabilityReading::from_windows`] turns an app's windows and open-builds
//! line into the reading. The standalone endpoint calls it with windows it read
//! for one app; this module calls it with the windows [`super::verdict::measure`]
//! already read for the whole page. Only where the windows come from differs
//! (`get_app_availability` against `get_fleet_availability`, which share their
//! predicates).
//!
//! ## What it will not say
//!
//! The field is present only for a published app that was measured. A draft, a
//! deployment with capture off, a failed query and a store that did not answer
//! within [`BUDGET`] all leave it absent. Absent means "not read here" — a
//! consumer asks the per-app endpoint or says nothing, and never reads it as
//! `healthy`. `no_opinion` inside the field is a measured "not enough traffic".
//!
//! ## Cost
//!
//! A standalone availability read is seven ClickHouse round trips for one app:
//! one per window in `ALERT_WINDOWS_MINUTES` (six) and one for open builds. It
//! is not an in-memory read, so the list never calls it per app.
//!
//! On the list the windows come from `verdict::measure`, which was already
//! reading them to compute `verdict` and keeps them in its cache: the field adds
//! no availability read. Open builds are the one added read: one `app_environments`
//! query and one grouped ClickHouse query for the apps on the page that are not
//! cached, none when they all are. Both caches are `TtlLru`s with a 30 second
//! [`TTL`](super::verdict) and 4096 entries, so a console that refetches on every
//! window focus costs one set of reads per 30 seconds per replica rather than one
//! per focus. Past 4096 apps the least recently read entry goes first.

//! `llmCostUsd` and `llmUnpricedRuns`: what an org's agent runs cost in LLM
//! usage, per window, priced the way Admin → Metrics prices it.
//!
//! **The runs are `agentRuns`' runs.** A window's roots are the top-level runs
//! `agentRuns` counts in it (`exclude_daemon_runs`: no platform daemon, no
//! staff preview or dry run), and each brings every run it delegated to, at
//! any depth. A delegated run is created without its root's source or
//! metadata, so it cannot be judged on its own row: it is its root's cost, in
//! its root's window. A window's cost is therefore what that window's
//! `agentRuns` cost. Admin → Metrics' per-org figure prices every run in the
//! org's workspaces, so it reads higher by exactly the platform's and staff's
//! own runs (and its days are rolling, not ISO weeks).
//!
//! **Priced as Admin → Metrics prices**: the same per-run model and token sums
//! (`metrics_rollup::RUN_TOKENS`), summed per org, window and model, and the
//! same rates (`metrics_pricing::price`). A model the rate table lacks adds
//! nothing to the dollars and counts its runs in `llmUnpricedRuns`, as Admin →
//! Metrics' `run_count - priced_run_count` does. Tokens and a model name are
//! all it reads from an event: no prompt, no answer.
//!
//! **Bounded like `agentRuns`**: the roots are cut to the windows' outer
//! bounds, the descent follows the `parent_run_id` index and the events their
//! `(run_id, seq)` index.

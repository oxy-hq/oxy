//! The demo fixture: `pulse-demo` ("Pulse (demo fixture)"), a custom app with
//! Oxy Functions and a seven-day release history, in the Local org's demo
//! workspace. `oxy seed --fixtures` builds it; `just up` passes the flag. It
//! feeds the console's release timeline, Issues and function views with data
//! a fresh dev box otherwise lacks (`oxy-starter` has no functions).
//!
//! **What is real and what is seeded.**
//!
//! - Real: the five builds, their publishes and the four promotes — the
//!   production code paths, called in this process (`releases`); the schedules
//!   the promotes register; the audit rows; and the runs queued at the end
//!   (`RUNS`), which the server's worker executes on production's build.
//! - Seeded: the timestamps of the release history (`calendar`), and the
//!   traffic before the seed — invocation rows (`history`) and Web Vitals
//!   (`vitals`). No real path can make either happen in the past.
//!
//! **The end state** is the bad release live: r1, r2 and r3 promoted in turn,
//! r4 promoted six hours ago with a `store` that throws on a stale store id
//! and runs several times slower, and r5 — the fix — published to staging. The
//! demo is to roll back from r4 and then promote r5.
//!
//! **No OLTP.** The fixture never provisions a per-org OLTP database: doing so
//! from a seed every developer runs would change how the demo workspace's own
//! compile settles its `schemas/`, on every later `just up`. It prints the
//! command that would.
//!
//! **Idempotent.** The app's id is derived from the org (`fixture_app_id`), so
//! every path proves the row is the fixture's before touching it, and a
//! developer's own `local/pulse-demo` is left alone. A fixture whose five
//! builds exist and whose last-written row (the sentinel, `vitals::
//! sentinel_event_id`) is there is *present* and nothing is done, whatever the
//! presenter has since moved; anything less — a seed that stopped part way —
//! is removed and rebuilt.
//!
//! The bundle is `customer-apps/examples/pulse-demo/` — outside the
//! `./examples` workspace the compile walks, and reviewable as plain files.

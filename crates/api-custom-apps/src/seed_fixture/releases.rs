//! The fixture's release history, made by the real code paths, in the seed
//! process: five channel publishes (`publish_to`, which admits, inflates,
//! validates, stores, records the build and its functions, moves staging and
//! reconciles staging's schedules), each followed by the publish audit row the
//! HTTP handler writes, and four promotes through the plan routes' own act
//! (`custom_apps_promote::act::promote`: plan, blockers, the one production
//! function, production's schedule reconcile, the audit row).
//!
//! The actor is the seeded App Operator — publish resolves an unscoped
//! operator as staff. Sequence: r1, r2, r3 and r4 each published and promoted;
//! r5 published to staging only. Production ends on r4, the bad release.

//! Removing the fixture: `oxy seed --clear`, and a rebuild of a fixture that
//! is partial or out of date (a crash mid-way, or an edited bundle file).
//!
//! Only the app with the fixture's derived id is touched; a developer's own
//! `local/pulse-demo` has another id and is left alone. Order matters:
//!
//! 1. **Schedules first.** Production's and staging's function schedules are
//!    rows keyed by the string `<app_id>/<function>` (or `<app_id>/<env>/…`),
//!    which no foreign key reaches: deleting the app would leave `snapshot`
//!    and `digest` firing at an app that no longer exists. Each is reconciled
//!    to nothing.
//! 2. **Bytes, then the row.** The bundle bytes and the asset silo, then the
//!    `apps` row, whose foreign keys cascade to the builds, functions,
//!    invocations, events and environments.

//! The audit rows of a production move, built in one place so the single
//! handlers and the batch handlers cannot write different ones.
//!
//! Three rows, each named by what the person did:
//!
//! | Action | Written for | Target |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `app.published` | the console's *Make Live* | the app |
//! | `app.unpublished` | the console's *Unpublish* | the app |
//! | `app.promoted` / `app.rolled_back` | `oxyc promote` / `oxyc rollback`, the console's rollback and promote latest | the app's environment, with `{from, build, previous}` |
//!
//! A single handler records its row after its move has committed
//! ([`audit::record_best_effort`]): the move stands either way. A batch
//! handler asks the move to record the row itself ([`AuditedBy::Move`]), in
//! the transaction holding the app's row lock, so a move that is refused or
//! rolled back leaves no row, and a row that cannot be written leaves no move.

//! Where an invocation's call trace ([`crate::call_trace`]) is kept:
//! `app_function_invocation_calls`, one row per invocation that reached
//! tenant code, Control-placed (`crates/app/tests/platform/data_placement.rs`).
//!
//! **Off the request path.** [`spawn_write`] hands the row to a task of its
//! own and returns at once, so a `/fn` answer never waits on the INSERT (the
//! custom-app perf rule: usage writes are off the request path). A lost write
//! reads back as `not_recorded`, which the console already shows.
//!
//! **Why Postgres and not the product ClickHouse store**, where span-shaped
//! data otherwise lives: product capture is opt-in and off on a dev box, so a
//! waterfall read from it would go dark exactly where people debug. The bound
//! is by design instead: at most `MAX_TRACED_CALLS` calls a row, and a
//! [`retention_days`] prune (default 3) run by the tracking cleanup loop.

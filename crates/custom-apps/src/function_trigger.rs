//! Why a one-off custom-app function job was queued, and the trigger the
//! runner reads back from the task's label.
//!
//! Two closed enums, moved out of `oxy-app` unchanged (domain-boundaries S6
//! step 3). [`FunctionJobTrigger`] is what a caller states when it queues a job;
//! [`QueuedTrigger`] is what the runner reads back from the label. They stay
//! together because [`FunctionJobTrigger::queued`] maps one to the other.

/// Why a one-off function job was enqueued.
///
/// An enum rather than a `&str` because the label is not free text: it is
/// replayed by `app_function_executor` as the invocation `mode`, and any value
/// that executor does not recognise silently becomes `schedule` — a function
/// branching on `mode` would then be told a webhook was a cron fire. Making the
/// set closed here means a new trigger cannot be added without visiting that
/// match.

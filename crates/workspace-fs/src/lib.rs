//! The `WorkspaceFs` port — the seam between the stateless serving plane and the
//! filesystem-owning workspace environment.
//!
//! Design: `internal-docs/2026-06-16-ephemeral-workspace-environments-design.md`
//!
//! This crate holds ONLY the contract (the trait + its data types), so **both**
//! planes can depend on it:
//! - the **workspace environment** links `oxy-workspace-env`, which provides the
//!   real, disk-backed `LocalWorkspaceFs` implementation;
//! - the **stateless serving fleet** links a `RemoteWorkspaceFs` implementation
//!   (an HTTP proxy to the environment) and **must not** link `oxy-workspace-env`.
//!
//! Keeping the impl out of the serving binary's dependency graph is the
//! structural guarantee (Rung 2): "touch the disk on a stateless replica" stops
//! being a runtime misclassification (the `/apps/source` class of bug) and
//! becomes a thing you cannot compile.
//!
//! Every route currently classified `IdeOnly` in the app's `role_manifest` is,
//! by definition, an operation that belongs behind this port. The surface grows
//! here one handler at a time during the crate move (Stage 1 of the plan).

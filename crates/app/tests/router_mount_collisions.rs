//! Two mounts of one path panic when the router is BUILT, not when it is served.
//!
//! This matters because of how routes are mounted now. `RoleRouter` finishes each
//! route's handlers with their own state and attaches them with `route_service`,
//! and `route_service` does not merge verbs the way `route` does — so the twelve
//! paths that used to be registered twice had to become one call each. A missed
//! one would take the server down at startup, and no unit test asserts "these
//! paths are distinct".
//!
//! Nothing needs to: building the router IS the check. These tests pin the two
//! halves of that reasoning — that a collision really panics, in all three
//! composition forms, and that the real router builds anyway.
//!
//! Each `should_panic` names the message. A bare one passes on ANY panic, so it
//! would go green if axum started rejecting these routers for some unrelated
//! reason — a check that inspects nothing, which is the failure this file exists
//! to rule out.

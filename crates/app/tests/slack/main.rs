//! Slack integration tests — OAuth install/state, workspace resolution, user
//! links, uninstall, webhook events, and the app-home surface.
//!
//! One binary for the whole domain; see `tests/authz/main.rs` for why. Add a
//! case as a `mod` here rather than a new `tests/*.rs`.
//!
//! This binary is MIXED. `slack_app_home` and `slack_webhook_events` are
//! in-process and run fully parallel; the other six call `establish_connection()`
//! against the raw shared `OXY_DATABASE_URL` with no per-test database, and are
//! pinned into `serial-db` by `.config/nextest.toml`. They skip when the var is
//! unset, so only CI would ever surface the race. `authz::shared_db_registry`
//! fails the build if that list drifts.

//! The run row's status transitions, against a real database.
//!
//! `store/tests.rs` pins the *shape* of the claim statement — that its `WHERE`
//! carries a status precondition at all. What it cannot show is the thing the
//! precondition exists for, because that property is a **sequence**: a run that
//! reached a terminal status, followed by a late claim from a second attempt of
//! the same task, must still be terminal afterwards. That needs two writes and
//! a row to survive between them.
//!
//! Two attempts of one payload is routine, not exotic. The durable queue's
//! reaper requeues a task whose lease expired, and the transport drops an
//! outcome whose claim a peer has taken over (`TerminalWrite::NotOwned` — "this
//! process just finished work the queue is discarding"): in that second case the
//! run row is already `done` while the queue row is still claimed, so the reaper
//! hands the payload out again and the second attempt claims a finished run.
//!
//! What a resurrected run costs, concretely: `api::simulation::runs::limits`
//! counts `queued`/`running` against `MAX_IN_FLIGHT_PER_WORKSPACE`, so the row
//! holds a workspace cap slot until `IN_FLIGHT_MAX_AGE_HOURS` ages it out — and
//! a reader scoped to terminal runs stops seeing evidence already written.

//! Cross-pod delivery for the world-model live feed.
//!
//! The bug this pins: the broadcast bus in `world_model.rs` is per process.
//! `POST /api/webhooks/toast/orders` is `FleetOk` and runs on a `serve`
//! replica; `GET /api/{ws}/world-model/events` was `IdeOnly` and proxied to the
//! ide. Publisher and subscriber were therefore never in the same process, so
//! every order ripple was dropped — the LIVE EVENTS panel stayed empty even
//! after #2816 stopped the webhook returning 401.
//!
//! These assertions are about the fan-out, not the classification, so they hold
//! whichever role the SSE route carries — which is what let it become `FleetOk`.
//!
//! Two invariants, both of which failed before this change:
//!
//! 1. **Publishing is durable.** `publish_order` must leave a row behind, not
//!    only shout into an in-process channel nobody on this pod is listening to.
//! 2. **A row written by another process reaches this process's subscribers.**
//!    That is what makes the fan-out cross-pod, and it is simulated here by
//!    inserting the row directly — exactly what a different replica's writer
//!    would have done.
//!
//! Spins up a Postgres testcontainer (or reuses `OXY_DATABASE_URL` in CI).

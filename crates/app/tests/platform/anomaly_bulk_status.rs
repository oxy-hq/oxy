//! The tenant boundary on the bulk anomaly-status write.
//!
//! `POST /semantic/anomalies/status` takes a caller-supplied id list, and the
//! only thing standing between that list and another tenant's rows is the
//! `workspace_id` predicate — on **both** statements the write runs: the
//! candidate count that decides what the toast reports, and the `UPDATE`
//! itself. That predicate is exactly the kind of clause a later refactor drops
//! while every unit test keeps passing, and naming one statement when there are
//! two is how the other one's copy goes unmissed — so both are asserted here
//! against a real database rather than reasoned about.
//!
//! Drives `apply_status_bulk` directly: the id normalisation and the HTTP shape
//! have their own unit tests, and going through the router would pull in
//! `api_router`, which reaches the *shared* database (see
//! `authz::shared_db_registry`). This uses `common::fresh_db`, so it gets its
//! own database and stays in `db-per-test`.

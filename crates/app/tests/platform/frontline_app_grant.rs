//! The custom-app gate's frontline term, against a real database.
//!
//! This is the test two rounds of review asked for and two commit messages
//! promised. Both frontline defects on this branch lived in exactly this
//! decision and neither was reachable from a unit test:
//!
//!   * the first version admitted any active worker and trusted `Ring::AppAccess`
//!     to narrow it — but the ring is handed a WORKSPACE id where it expects an
//!     app id, so it never narrowed anything, and the term was live only while
//!     the fact loader was erroring;
//!   * the second required a grant but was then zeroed by `enforce`'s
//!     conjunction, so a granted worker got 403 on every healthy request.
//!
//! What makes those catchable here and not above is the join. The decision is
//! "active standing AND a grant on an app in THIS workspace", and every way of
//! getting it wrong — dropping the standing check, dropping the grant check,
//! scoping the grant to the org instead of the workspace — still passes a happy
//! path with one worker, one app and one grant. So each case below removes
//! exactly one of those and asserts the answer flips.

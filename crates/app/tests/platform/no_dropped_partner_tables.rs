//! Guard: no source file may reference a partner table that no longer exists.
//!
//! The 2026-07-14 permission model dropped `partners`, `partner_members` and
//! `partner_member_orgs` (a partner IS an org now; its people are `org_members`).
//! Sea-ORM call sites broke loudly at compile time — but **two raw SQL queries
//! did not**, and shipped:
//!
//!   admin/orgs_admin.rs   `JOIN partners p ON p.id = po.partner_id`
//!   admin/users_admin.rs  `FROM partner_members pm JOIN partners p ...`
//!
//! Both compiled clean and then 500'd at runtime with
//! `relation "partners" does not exist`, taking down the admin Organizations and
//! Users lists. A green `cargo check` said nothing, because a SQL string is just
//! a string.
//!
//! So this test is the type-checker the raw-SQL escape hatch doesn't have. It
//! reads the crate's own sources and fails if a dropped table name appears in
//! one. Comments and doc-comments are stripped first — the migration and the
//! design notes legitimately *talk about* these tables; what must never appear is
//! a live reference.

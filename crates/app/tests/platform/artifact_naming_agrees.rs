//! The compiled arm and the working-copy arm must derive the same name for the
//! same file, or a workspace shows different app names depending on whether it
//! has been compiled.
//!
//! `oxy_compile::compile::derive_name_from_path` is the rule the compile worker
//! writes into `*_definitions.name`. `oxy::config::artifact_name` is the copy the
//! filesystem arm uses, because `crates/core` cannot depend on `oxy-compile`
//! without a new cross-layer edge. Two copies drift; this is what stops them.
//!
//! `oxy-app` is the only crate that depends on both.

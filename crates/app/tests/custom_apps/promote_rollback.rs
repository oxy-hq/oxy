//! `oxyc promote` / `oxyc rollback` (environments design §5.5a), through the
//! real routers in a staff person's session, and the one production move every
//! other writer of production's pointer now goes through.
//!
//! | Module | Proves |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `paths` | staging → production and a sandbox → staging move their pointer, write their event and audit row, and answer the plan; every other pair is `400 promote_path_refused`; `already_serving`; `target_moved`; `--build` must be a build the source served; a promoting publish records staging's event first and warns it is deprecated |
//! | `invariant` | a build staging never served is refused on the new route, Make Live, the console's rollback and promote latest; the move re-asks under the app's row lock, so a pointer or a validation that changed while it waited refuses it |
//! | `lock_resolved` | a move aimed at the draft or the newest build names it under the app's row lock: a draft publish (or a newer build) landing between the caller's read and the lock is the build made live |
//! | `migrations` | a production move applies the build's pending OLTP files before the pointer moves — the new route and Make Live alike — and a failing file leaves the pointer where it was, answered with the migration's own status |
//! | `rollback` | the default target is the previous build (twice swaps back), `--to` names one the environment served, a sandbox is `not_rollbackable`, an environment with nothing before is `nothing_to_roll_back_to` |
//! | `blockers` | an unset `required` key blocks a promote and only warns a rollback; retiring a registered schedule needs the function named; rollback re-registers its target's schedules |
//! | `batch_audit` | the batch publish, promote-latest and unpublish write the single handlers' audit row for every app they move, for the same actor, in the move's transaction; an app whose move is refused has none |
//! | `agent_built` | a build a sandbox agent token published is `409 draft_published_by_agent` on every new path — promote from staging, a sandbox's promote to staging, a staging rollback — dry runs included |

//! The platform's browser-side runtime, end to end against the seeded app:
//! the reserved `__oxy/` namespace, the asset manifest, the preload hints the
//! manifest produces, and the telemetry beacon.
//!
//! These are integration tests rather than unit tests because every one of them
//! is about a *seam*. Each piece has unit coverage already — the manifest
//! builder, the beacon's admission rules, the header assembly — and each passed
//! while the whole was broken in at least one of the ways below:
//!
//! - the reserved dispatch sits between the auth gate and the source dispatch,
//!   so a misplacement serves the worker to the wrong people or 404s it;
//! - the manifest is written at publish and read at serve through the object
//!   store, so the two halves can disagree about its path or its shape;
//! - the `Link` header exists only if the manifest was written, was found, and
//!   parsed — three separate ways to end up with a silently slower app that
//!   still renders perfectly.
//!
//! Auth: `BuiltInAuthenticator` falls back to a guest identity when no auth
//! method is configured. The guest is a plain user with no standing, so the
//! membership gate is exercised for real.

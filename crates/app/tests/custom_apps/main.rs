//! Custom Apps platform tests — access control, visibility, the compile/serve
//! boundary, cache invalidation, and the seeded example app.
//!
//! One binary for the whole domain; see `tests/authz/main.rs` for why. Add a
//! case as a `mod` here rather than a new `tests/*.rs`.
//!
//! Most of these are database-backed via [`common::test_db`], which gives each
//! test its own database cloned from a per-run template. The binary is therefore
//! in the `db-per-test` group (`max-threads = 4`) in `.config/nextest.toml`, not
//! the fully-serialized `serial-db` group — they contend for one Postgres server,
//! not for a schema.

//! `oxy seed` — demo conversation threads for the seeded workspace.
//!
//! Gives a freshly-seeded box a Chat surface with history in it: the threads
//! list, the recents rail and the analytics thread view all render real
//! transcripts instead of an empty state, so a developer can open the feature
//! they're working on without first spending an LLM call to manufacture one.
//!
//! **Threads are user-scoped**, and that shapes everything here. `get_threads`
//! filters on `user_id = <caller>` (and `get_thread` does the same unless the
//! caller holds an operator session), so a thread owned by a fabricated user
//! would be invisible to whoever actually logs in — seeded and useless. Each
//! fixture is therefore materialized **once per member of the Local org**,
//! which is exactly the set `bind_org_admin_emails` creates from
//! `OXY_GLOBAL_ADMINS`. Whoever signs in sees their own copy.
//!
//! A thread is four tables, and the fixtures carry all four:
//!
//! ```text
//! threads ──┬── agentic_runs ──┬── agentic_run_events   (the transcript)
//!           │                  └── analytics_run_extensions
//!           └─ (user_id, project_id)
//! ```
//!
//! Events are stored **raw**, exactly as the pipeline wrote them (`state_enter`,
//! `llm_token`, `state_exit`, …), not as the `step_start` / `text_delta` shapes
//! the API returns. The read path runs them through the domain's stateful
//! `RowProcessor`, which is what synthesizes `step_end` metadata and squashes
//! token deltas — so a fixture recorded from the API response would double-
//! process and render wrong. `wow-sales-growth.json` is a verbatim dump of a
//! real run's rows for that reason; see the fixture table below.
//!
//! Idempotent — a thread whose deterministic id is already present is left
//! untouched, so a re-run never clobbers a conversation someone continued.

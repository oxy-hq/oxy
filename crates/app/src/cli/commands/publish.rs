//! `oxy publish` — self-contained, CI-free deploy for custom apps.
//!
//! From an app directory an engineer runs `oxy publish --env <env>`. The
//! command reads `oxy-app.json`, builds the bundle per its `build` section
//! (or defaults), resolves the target oxy from its `environments` (or
//! defaults), auto-resolves the project from `<target>/api/apps/<org>/<app>/
//! build-config`, authenticates with the token cached by `oxy login` (or
//! `OXY_TOKEN`), and POSTs the tarball to `<target>/api/customer-apps/publish`.
//!
//! Nothing lives in GitHub: no project id, no target var, no per-app build
//! steps — the manifest + `oxy login` carry it all. `--dir` skips the build
//! and uploads a pre-built directory (escape hatch / CI).

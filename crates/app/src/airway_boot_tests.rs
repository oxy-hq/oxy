//! Tests for the boot seam: that a configured row reaches airway's
//! process-wide `GlobalConfig` **without any airway run**, and that a process
//! with no database degrades to airway's own built-ins.
//!
//! DB-backed tests skip (never fail) when `OXY_DATABASE_URL` is unset, per
//! `test_support::test_db` — grep a run for `skipping:` before believing a
//! PASS.
//!
//! # Only one of these installs, and it says so
//!
//! airway's `install` is a process-wide `OnceLock` and
//! `deployment_config::install_once` is `OnceCell`-guarded on top of it, so
//! "has anything installed yet?" is a property of the *process*, not of a
//! test. nextest runs every test in its own process, which is what makes
//! [`the_boot_seam_installs_without_a_run`]'s "nothing installed before me"
//! precondition affordable — it is the only test in this crate that installs.
//!
//! Under a hypothetical shared process (`cargo test`, which this repo does not
//! use) that precondition would fail loudly rather than silently weaken, and
//! [`no_database_degrades_to_airways_own_defaults`] is written to stay
//! meaningful either way: it asserts the installed state is *unchanged* across
//! the no-database call, which is the actual property under test, and only
//! additionally asserts "still nothing installed" when nothing was installed
//! going in.

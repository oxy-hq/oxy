//! Install airway's **deployment (operational) tier** at process boot.
//!
//! The tier itself — the singleton `airway_deployment_config` row, its mapping
//! onto airway's `GlobalConfig`, and the one-shot install — lives in
//! [`agentic_airway::deployment_config`]. This module is only the *seam*: when
//! in a process's life the install happens, and what a process with no
//! database does instead.
//!
//! # Why boot, and not the first run
//!
//! airway keeps `GlobalConfig` in a process-wide `OnceLock` that
//! `HttpConfig::default` and `RetryConfig::default` read, so **one install
//! covers every connector the process ever builds**. Installing at the top of
//! `run_pipeline` instead covers every airway *load* and nothing else — and at
//! least one site builds a source connector and talks to the vendor outside
//! any load: `agentic_pipeline::airway_run::discover_airway_source_tables`,
//! behind `POST /sources/discover`, the create-pipeline wizard's table picker.
//!
//! TLS is the sharp edge. An operator who configures a custom CA bundle would
//! find real runs honour it while the wizard's table picker fails to connect —
//! which reads as a broken source rather than a config gap, and sends them
//! looking at the vendor instead of at their own setting.
//!
//! Hoisting the install here closes that **without a signature change
//! anywhere**: no `DatabaseConnection` threaded into a discovery function
//! whose contract is explicitly "no DB/platform context required", and any
//! future connector site is covered by construction rather than by someone
//! remembering. It also matches the tier's documented semantics exactly — read
//! once, one-shot, restart to change.
//!
//! # The seams
//!
//! One per entry point that can build an airway source connector:
//!
//! | entry point | seam |
//! |---|---|
//! | `oxy serve`, and `oxy start` which delegates to it — every `OXY_ROLE` (`ide`, `serve`, `worker`, `all`) | [`crate::cli::commands::serve::start_server_and_web_app`], after migrations and before the router (and its in-process worker fleet) is built |
//! | `oxy worker` — the standalone fleet worker | [`crate::cli::commands::worker::run_worker`], after migrations and before `WorkerRuntime::start` |
//! | `oxy airway run` / `backfill` / `coverage` | `cli::commands::airway::connect_db`, the one connect path all three share |
//!
//! Deliberately absent, each for a reason that is checkable rather than a
//! guess:
//!
//! - **`oxy admin --airway`** seeds a `TaskSpec::Airway` onto the queue and
//!   exits. The connector is built by whichever worker claims the row, and
//!   that worker installed at its own boot.
//! - **`oxy compile`** and **`oxy run`** never build a source connector.
//!   `oxy run` in particular must keep working with no database at all, so
//!   giving it a boot install would trade a real capability for a setting it
//!   cannot use.
//!
//! # Boot never fails on this
//!
//! Two failure shapes, kept apart on purpose:
//!
//! - **No database.** [`install_deployment_tier`] takes `Option`, and `None`
//!   is a first-class answer: airway's own compiled-in timeout, retry and TLS
//!   settings stay in force, which is exactly right — there is no row to read.
//! - **A row airway refuses.** Logged at `warn` and boot continues. The tier's
//!   own rule is that a malformed row *fails the run* rather than falling back
//!   silently, and that rule is preserved by the `install_once` call still
//!   sitting in `run_pipeline`: `OnceCell::get_or_try_init` does not cache an
//!   `Err`, so the run re-reads the row and raises the error onto the
//!   operator's SSE stream, where it is legible. Refusing to *boot* over it
//!   would take down a whole serve replica for a setting most of it never
//!   touches.
//!
//! That surviving `run_pipeline` call is also the fallback for any process
//! with no oxy-app boot seam — an integration test, a future binary, an
//! embedder of `agentic-airway`. It is not a duplicate install: after a
//! successful boot install the `OnceCell` is populated, so the second call
//! returns without running its closure and without logging anything.

//! Probe + metrics surface for `oxy worker`.
//!
//! Exposes `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz` and — when the caller passes
//! metrics state, which today is exactly when `--health-port` /
//! `OXY_WORKER_HEALTH_PORT` is set on `oxy worker` — `GET /metrics`, all on
//! one dedicated TCP port. `spawn` is `pub` and still supports `None` for
//! tests and local mode, so treat the flag as the current caller rather than
//! the rule. No Oxy *application* routes are mounted, so a probe can never
//! reach an authenticated endpoint.
//!
//! It is NOT stateless. `/metrics` makes two DB round trips per scrape (see
//! `worker_metrics::metrics`), so this listener is DB-touching and
//! unauthenticated. Keep it cluster-internal — never behind a Service or
//! Ingress that faces anything else.
//!
//! That is a deployment constraint, NOT something this file enforces: the
//! bind below is `0.0.0.0`, so on a host-network pod or a node with a public
//! IP the port is reachable by anything that can route to it. Enforce it with
//! a NetworkPolicy or by not publishing the port. The exposure matters
//! because the queue-depth query is a sequential scan over every retained row
//! (`worker_metrics::read_queue_depth`), which is unbounded if either
//! retention TTL is disabled.
//!
//! The original "probe-only, so it can't hit stateful endpoints" guarantee
//! stopped being true when `/metrics` landed here.
//!
//! Lifetime is tied to the same umbrella `CancellationToken` the worker
//! uses, so `Ctrl+C`/SIGTERM cleanly tears the health server down with the
//! rest of the worker.

//! The declared grid: which worlds a revision carries, and where to read one.
//!
//! Boundary first, working copy second — but not decided here. A world is a
//! compiled `simulation_definitions` row on any node that has one, and a file
//! on disk only where a working copy exists, and which of those a read uses is
//! `ConfigManager`'s single `Origin` match rather than a three-arm match
//! repeated at every call site. Both arms read persisted rows or the node's own
//! working copy, which is why these routes stay `FleetOk`.
//!
//! Branch semantics come with the manager: `workspace_middleware` pins the
//! request to one revision and yields none for a non-default branch on a node
//! that HAS a working copy, so the IDE previewing uncommitted edits on a
//! feature branch still reads the files. That is why nothing here takes a
//! `branch` of its own — `?branch=` is read once, by the middleware.

//! The paired profit race, read out of Postgres in one pass.
//!
//! [`oxy_simulation::race`] settles which arm won and whether the margin is a
//! finding. It is horizon-agnostic and keyed: hand it one profit number per
//! world per arm and it does the rest. Nothing could hand it those numbers in
//! bulk — `GET /simulations/runs` carries `policy` and `replicate` but no
//! profit, and `cumulative_profit` is a column on `simulation_run_periods`
//! reachable only one run at a time. A race was therefore a listing plus N
//! reads, paired in whatever the caller wrote. This module is the missing read,
//! and it pairs on the server so the pairing is one implementation rather than
//! one per caller.
//!
//! # The SPEC is the world, and it is what pairs
//!
//! `race`'s module docs make the paired test conditional on one fact: replicate
//! *k* of every arm saw the same world, because `replicate_seed(base, k) =
//! base + k` takes no policy argument and [`World`](oxy_simulation::World) draws
//! its exogenous streams from the spec seed alone. That fact holds only while
//! **the whole spec** is unchanged — the seed is what makes one world's draws
//! differ from another's, but every other field is what makes it that world at
//! all.
//!
//! Two edits break the pairing, and only one of them moves the seed:
//!
//! * Edit `seed:` between queueing arm A and arm B and replicate 0 of each is a
//!   different world, so a *replicate*-keyed pairing fabricates a comparison.
//!   With the base moved 7 → 8, `(base 7, replicate 1)` and
//!   `(base 8, replicate 0)` are both seed 8, ARE the same world, and pair
//!   despite differing labels.
//! * Edit anything else — `entities.count` 100 → 500, `noise_ratio`,
//!   `lag_days`, `period_days`, `scale_sigma` — and the seeds still match while
//!   the worlds do not. A *seed*-keyed pairing then reports the edit as a
//!   policy effect: `machine` carrying ~5× the profit of `hold` for reasons
//!   nothing about the policy explains, with `dropped_unpaired: 0` and a
//!   confident p-value. That is the worse of the two failures, because nothing
//!   in the response looks wrong.
//!
//! So the pairing key is the whole world: the **seed** each run stored for
//! itself, plus a fingerprint of [`simulation_runs::Column::Spec`], the spec
//! snapshot `queue_one` wrote for that run. The seed half is redundant — the
//! snapshot is seed-substituted, so the fingerprint already subsumes it — and
//! is kept only because it orders the worlds the way a reader reads them.
//!
//! The fingerprint is over a *canonical* rendering of the spec (object keys
//! sorted, recursively), because the column is `jsonb` and Postgres does not
//! preserve key order: hashing the bytes as they come back would make one world
//! two on a round trip. See [`spec_fingerprint`].
//!
//! `replicate` stays on the wire as the label a reader recognises, and
//! [`ReplicateReach::seed`] and [`ReplicateReach::world`] ride beside it,
//! because once a base seed has moved the replicate number no longer identifies
//! a draw — and once a spec has been edited, neither does the seed. When two
//! arms share no world at all the comparison is withheld as `disjoint_worlds` —
//! a named outcome, distinct from the `no_pairs` an unrun arm produces, which a
//! reader glosses as "no difference".
//!
//! # Only a run that stopped is evidence
//!
//! Runs are loaded with a **terminal** status only — `done`, `failed`,
//! `cancelled`, the three of the five in
//! `crates/app/src/server/simulation/store.rs` that nothing will move again.
//! Two reasons, and the first is the blocker:
//!
//! * a re-queued run is the newest row for its world and has no period rows at
//!   all, so admitting it would evict the completed run it repeats and blank a
//!   race that was already there;
//! * a `running` run's curve grows between two identical requests, so scoring
//!   it would move the horizon — and every margin under it — with nothing in
//!   the response saying why. `latest_run_per_draw`'s tie-break already refuses
//!   that ("a race whose numbers move between two identical requests is worse
//!   than either answer"), and a partial curve is the same defect on a longer
//!   clock.
//!
//! A `failed` run is kept: its curve is frozen, the periods it did record are
//! real, and the horizon rule below was written for exactly that raggedness.
//! In-flight runs are counted into [`ProfitRace::in_flight_runs`] rather than
//! dropped silently, the way `superseded_runs` already is.
//!
//! # The horizon is a choice, and it is reported
//!
//! Runs of one world end at different `periods_done` — an arm that failed, an
//! arm retried, an arm whose worker died. **Scoring each run at its own last period
//! row would race arm A at period 40 against arm B at period 12**, which is the
//! same class of error as misaligning replicates: the number that comes out is
//! not a comparison, and nothing in it says so. `ArmProfits` cannot catch it,
//! because by the time the profits reach it they are just numbers.
//!
//! So every arm is scored at ONE period index, and [`ProfitRace::horizon`] says
//! which. By default that is the **deepest period every recorded replicate
//! reached** — `min` over each run's last period — which is the only choice
//! that needs no argument about which runs deserve to be dropped, and the one
//! that maximises the paired sample. Its cost is real and worth stating: one
//! run that died at period 2 drags a five-arm race to period 2, throwing away
//! 38 periods of everyone else's evidence.
//!
//! That cost is why the horizon is a *parameter* and not just a rule.
//! [`ProfitRace::arms`] reports every replicate's `reach`, so a caller who sees
//! `horizon: 2` next to four arms reaching 40 can see exactly which draw held
//! it back, and `?horizon=40` re-runs the race at the depth they meant — with
//! the short replicate **dropped and counted** in `short`/`dropped_unpaired`,
//! never truncated to its own last row.
//!
//! Two drops exist and both are counted rather than swallowed:
//!
//! * a draw with no `cumulative_profit` row at the horizon — it never got that
//!   far, or it recorded nothing at all — is absent from that arm's
//!   [`ArmProfits`] and shows up in [`ArmCoverage::short`];
//! * a world one arm drew and the other did not is `dropped_unpaired`, counted
//!   by `race::compare` itself.
//!
//! # Which arm is the baseline
//!
//! `?baseline=` names it. Unset, it is the first arm present in
//! [`PolicyKind::ALL`] order — the null (`hold`), else what a customer does
//! today (`legacy`), and so on. That order is already "the reference arm
//! first", so the default reference is the most-null arm actually run rather
//! than whichever one sorted first alphabetically.
//!
//! # Multiplicity
//!
//! Every p-value here is **per-comparison and uncorrected** — `race`'s module
//! docs are emphatic about it, and this is the surface that decides the family.
//! [`ProfitRace::family_size`] is how many comparisons were run, so a reader can
//! see that "one arm cleared 0.05" out of four tries is a much weaker statement
//! than it looks. The correction is deliberately not applied here: which arms
//! belong to one family is the *caller's* question, and a surface that silently
//! Bonferroni'd four arms would be as wrong for a caller who only cares about
//! one of them.

/// which draw of a world, and the spec is which world. Both halves are in the
/// key, so a re-run of one world supersedes and a run of a world that was
/// *edited* under the same seed does not — the latter is a second world, and
/// evicting one with the other would silently answer a race over both with
/// whichever was queued last. See this module's docs.
///
/// An in-flight run is skipped **before** the key is even considered, so it can
/// neither win a slot nor be recorded as having superseded anything. That
/// ordering is the fix for the eviction: a re-queued run is by construction the
/// newest row for its world and has no period rows, so any rule that let it
/// reach the key would blank the finished race behind it.
///
/// A policy string that does not parse is skipped with a warning rather than
/// failing the race: the column is written from this same enum, so an
/// unrecognised value means the enum moved, and refusing to race the four arms
/// that *are* readable helps nobody. An unrecognised *status* is treated as
/// in-flight — the conservative read, since the alternative is scoring a curve
/// that may still be growing.

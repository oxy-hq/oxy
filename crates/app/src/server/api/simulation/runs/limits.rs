/// [`MAX_RUNS_PER_REQUEST`] bounds one click; this bounds the member who

/// per-pipeline lease because concurrent runs share a cursor and would fold
/// overlapping snapshots into one table. Simulation runs are independent —
/// each reads its own spec snapshot and writes its own rows — so nothing is
/// wrong with two of them running at once. The only concern is fleet
/// capacity, and a count answers that.
///
/// This once read the count outside any transaction and argued that "a cap
/// that is briefly off by one request is the right cost for not locking a
/// table nothing else contends on". That reasoning priced the race at one
/// request because it only ever imagined two. The cost is not bounded by the
/// overshoot of a single racer: every concurrent request reads the same stale
/// count, so the real bound was `MAX_IN_FLIGHT_PER_WORKSPACE × concurrency`,
/// and concurrency is the caller's to choose. Eight simultaneous requests of
/// sixteen queued 128 runs against this cap of 64 — measured, not reasoned
/// about, in `the_in_flight_cap_holds_when_requests_arrive_together`. Since
/// the route is reachable by any workspace member and each run is minutes of
/// blocking DuckDB and fitter CPU, that is a member-triggered denial of the
/// worker fleet, not an off-by-one.
///
/// So the count is now read under [`advisory_lock_key`] inside the same
/// transaction that inserts the run — see `runs::queue_one`. The lock is held
/// for one run's three writes, contends only with other queueing in the same

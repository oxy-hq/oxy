// ── OPERATOR NOTE — deliberately `//`, not `///` ─────────────────────────────
//
// utoipa lifts a handler's doc comment into the OpenAPI operation description,
// and the spec is served unauthenticated at /apidoc. Anything written with ///
// below ships to every deployment's API docs, self-hosted customers included,
// so the incident narrative and our internal topology stay in plain comments.
//
// WHY THIS ENDPOINT IS NOT A LIVENESS PROBE
//
// /health returns 503 when Postgres is unreachable. Wired to livenessProbe,
// that makes kubelet restart the pod during a database incident — a crash loop
// layered on top of an outage, and worst on a single-replica StatefulSet with
// an RWO volume, where the restart also risks a Multi-Attach stall. oxy-prod
// did exactly this until 2026-08-11; the doc comment here previously listed
// "Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes" as an intended use, which is where
// the misconfiguration came from.
//
// The deployed paths are /api/health, /api/live and /api/ready — these routes
// are only mounted inside the router nested at /api (see build_public_routes
// and its nest in serve.rs). The bare forms below match the #[utoipa::path]
// annotations, which are relative to the spec's `servers = ["/api"]`. A probe
// pointed at bare /live gets a 404, which kubelet counts as a failure — the
// same restart-during-incident outcome by a different route.
//
// A durable version of this guidance lives in internal-docs/, which is where
// whoever wires probes in the infrastructure repo will actually look.

/// Health check endpoint — for humans and uptime monitors.
///
/// Returns service health including database connectivity, plus the image tag
/// and build information. Unauthenticated. Served at `/api/health`.
///
/// Intended for external uptime monitoring (the build info aids triage) and for
/// operators asking "what is deployed, and can it reach its database?".
///
/// **Not a Kubernetes liveness probe** — it returns 503 when Postgres is
/// unreachable, which would restart the pod during a database incident. Use
/// [`liveness_check`] (`/live`, served at `/api/live`) for liveness and
/// [`readiness_check`] (`/ready`, served at `/api/ready`) for readiness and
/// load-balancer health.

// Fleet-wide failure mode, worth knowing before relying on this: every replica
// pings the SAME Postgres, so a database outage fails readiness across the

// "all traffic fails at the load balancer", not "traffic shifts to a healthy
// replica". There is no healthy replica to shift to.

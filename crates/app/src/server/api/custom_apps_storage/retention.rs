//! Retention for the custom-app asset store: TTL classes, the object tag that
//! carries one, and the bucket lifecycle rules that act on it.
//!
//! ## Why tags and not prefixes
//!
//! The obvious shape — one lifecycle rule per app prefix — does not scale. S3
//! caps a bucket at **1,000 lifecycle rules** and this bucket is shared by every
//! app, so at three prefix-classes per app it ceilings out around 330 apps and
//! then starts silently failing to protect new ones.
//!
//! So the rule set is **fixed and tiny**: one rule per TTL class, keyed on the
//! `oxy-ttl` object tag. Five rules, forever, no matter how many apps exist. Oxy
//! stamps the tag at write time from the app's declared policy; S3 does the
//! deleting, for free.
//!
//! ## This module does not apply anything
//!
//! **Terraform writes those rules; this module verifies them.** Oxy is still the
//! source of truth for *what* they must be — it stamps the tags they filter on —
//! but the infrastructure repo owns the bucket's lifecycle configuration, because
//! `PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration` replaces the whole thing and two
//! authoritative writers would delete each other's work forever. The reasoning is
//! in full beside [`verify_lifecycle_rules`].
//!
//! ## Fail open, always
//!
//! An object with no `oxy-ttl` tag **never expires**. Every path here that cannot
//! resolve a class — no manifest, an unparseable one, a prefix that matches
//! nothing, a class name we don't recognize — yields `None` and the object lives
//! forever. Deleting an author's data because a manifest line was missing or
//! misspelled is far worse than keeping bytes we could have reclaimed.
//!
//! ## Three behaviours that read as bugs but are not
//!
//! * **Expiry is not exact.** S3 evaluates tag-filtered rules daily, so an object
//!   tagged `1d` disappears *within about a day* of its first birthday, not on the
//!   hour.
//! * **Removing the tag cancels a pending delete.** S3 re-checks the tag when the
//!   queued action executes. That is how "pin this object" works, with no extra
//!   machinery.
//! * **Editing a manifest rule does not retag what is already stored.** New writes
//!   get the new class; existing objects keep theirs until something rewrites them.

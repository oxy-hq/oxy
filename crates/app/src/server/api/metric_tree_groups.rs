//! Asking the baseline's two reads one view at a time.
//!
//! Both reads batch: `reachable_values_outcome` puts every forward-reachable
//! node's measure in one `QueryRequest`, and `fit_driver_coefficients` puts
//! both endpoints of every fittable edge in one panel query. A batch spanning
//! two views is answered the only way SQL can — pick a base view and join the
//! rest in — so a single pair of views with no join path between them refuses
//! the whole request. Every other measure in the batch goes down with it,
//! including measures that are columns of the same row and needed no join at
//! all.
//!
//! Seen in a workspace whose P&L view (`quickbooks_pl`: one primary entity, no
//! foreign entities, monthly closed periods) carries driver edges down to daily
//! Toast aggregates. Pinning a labor lever produced nine "could not be sized
//! from history" refusals carrying an identical message — the signature of one
//! failed query attributed nine times. Exactly one of those edges genuinely
//! crossed the unjoinable pair; seven were single-view, three of them *inside*
//! the P&L.
//!
//! So group first, then batch. A group is one view, and the request it issues
//! names measures from that view alone — which is what makes the grouping safe
//! rather than merely narrower. `metric_tree_baseline` documents why an
//! arbitrary split is dangerous: a half that keeps the other view's time
//! dimension joins on a partial key and returns a whole-window total repeated
//! on every date, turning a loud refusal into a silent wrong number. A
//! single-view request cannot do that — there is no join to fan out — and the
//! time dimension is re-resolved against the group's own view rather than
//! carried across (see [`time_dimension_for`]).
//!
//! The cross-view remainder batches per view PAIR — the smallest unit a join
//! either supports or does not, and so the largest batch whose failure
//! implicates only the views named in it. A workspace where a cross-view fit
//! works today keeps it, since a pair asks for a subset of the joins the whole
//! remainder asked for; what changes is that one unjoinable pair no longer
//! takes down the pairs that join fine beside it. A pair owning neither end of
//! the window is refused for the window rather than queried, because the
//! anchor's view would otherwise join in as a third.
//!
//! Fitting edges that used to die in the batch exposed a second problem — a
//! per-row slope aggregates into a change in the target's SUM, which is not
//! what the target's window value means when the target is an average. That is
//! fixed where it belongs, in airlayer's `AggregateSpace` (PR #90): an identity
//! link converts into the target's space and a ratio refuses by name. This
//! module briefly carried a blanket refusal for it and no longer needs to.

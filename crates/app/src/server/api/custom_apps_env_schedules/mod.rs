//! A custom app's function schedules, per environment
//! (`internal-docs/2026-09-10-custom-app-environments-design.md` §4.5,
//! ruling 1).
//!
//! Production's schedules always run, registered by a promoting publish as
//! they always were. A non-production environment — staging or a
//! `dev-<handle>` sandbox — fires its functions' `schedule`s only once staff
//! turned its switch on (`app_environments.schedules_enabled`, off by
//! default): a schedule there reads production data on a timer and calls
//! third parties with staging's credentials.
//!
//! * [`reconcile`] — the `agentic_schedules` rows: production's two-segment
//!   refs at a promote, an environment's three-segment refs on every publish
//!   to it and every flip; [`lock`] keeps two reconciles of one environment
//!   apart;
//! * [`handlers`] — `GET`/`PUT …/environments/{name}/schedules`.
//!
//! A row fires through the global singleton's tick like production's
//! (`agentic_pipeline::function_schedule`), and the runner decides again
//! whether it may run (`custom_apps_functions::queued_admission`). A
//! sandbox's teardown retires its rows; the tenant's schedules API never sees
//! them (`api::schedules`).

//! A queued function run in a named app environment: how one is triggered,
//! and the rule that admits it there.
//!
//! **Outside production a queued run is admitted by what queued it**
//! ([`queued_admission`](super::queued_admission)): a manual run is a check —
//! a function its own build marks `"check": true` in `oxy-app.json`, the same
//! flag that lets a publish token run it in production
//! (`admin::apps::handlers::machine_may_run`); Run now `as=schedule` is a
//! function that declares a `schedule`; a cron fire also needs the
//! environment's schedules switch on; a webhook needs its `webhook` block.
//!
//! The rule is applied twice, on purpose. [`trigger`] refuses to *queue* a run
//! the build does not declare, so the caller hears `not_a_check` or
//! `not_scheduled` at once. [`admit_queued`] refuses to *run* one, reading the
//! declarations again from the build the worker actually resolved — the task
//! sat in a queue, and the environment's pointer may have moved to a build
//! where the function no longer declares what it was queued as.
//!
//! Always compiled: the trigger only writes a run and a task, so it works on a
//! node built without the isolate (`custom-app-functions`).

//! The per-build **asset manifest** — the small JSON document that turns a
//! published bundle from "a pile of objects in a prefix" into something the
//! serve plane and the browser can reason about ahead of time.
//!
//! It exists because everything fast about loading a bundle needs to know the
//! file list *before* the browser discovers it by parsing HTML:
//!
//! - **`Link: rel=preload` / `rel=modulepreload` on the HTML response.** The
//!   entry chunks start downloading while the HTML is still in flight, instead
//!   of one RTT later when the parser reaches the `<script>` tag. This is the
//!   single biggest first-load win available at the origin, and it is exactly
//!   what Firebase Hosting and Cloudflare Pages synthesise from their own build
//!   output.
//! - **Service-worker precache** (`custom_apps_service_worker`). The worker
//!   fetches this document at install and pins the build's entry assets, so the
//!   *second* load of an app is zero network for everything but the shell.
//! - **Publish-time cache warming.** `custom_apps_publish` seeds the bundle LRU
//!   with the entries named here, so the first visitor after a publish doesn't
//!   pay a cold object-store round-trip per critical chunk.
//!
//! ## Why it is a build artifact, not a database column
//!
//! The manifest is written *into the build prefix* at publish
//! (`__oxy/asset-manifest.json`) rather than onto the `app_builds` row. Three
//! reasons, in order of weight:
//!
//! 1. **It is build-scoped by construction.** The bundle cache keys on
//!    `(app_id, build_id, rel_path)`, so a promote or rollback serves the right
//!    manifest with no invalidation, exactly like every other object in the
//!    build. A column would need its own cache and its own drop sites.
//! 2. **It reads through machinery that already exists** — the same LRU, the
//!    same absence caching, the same pre-compression. A build published before
//!    this module existed simply has no such object, the absence is remembered
//!    once per process, and every caller degrades to "no manifest" rather than
//!    erroring.
//! 3. **No migration.** A JSONB column would have been a schema change for data
//!    that is immutable, per-build, and already has a natural home.
//!
//! ## Scope of `entries` vs `assets`
//!
//! `entries` is the **critical path**: the scripts and stylesheets the entry
//! HTML references directly, in document order. It is what gets preload hints
//! and what the worker precaches — a bounded, small list.
//!
//! `assets` is the **full precacheable set**: every content-hashed file in the
//! build. It is what the worker is *allowed* to serve cache-first without
//! revalidating, because a hashed URL can only change when its bytes do. It is
//! deliberately not precached eagerly — a big bundle would spend the visitor's
//! bandwidth on routes they may never open.

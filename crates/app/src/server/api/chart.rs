/// Serve a legacy visualize-task chart file (the `:chart{chart_src=NAME}`
/// directive renders by fetching this). The file is written to the ide's local
/// disk by the run, so this route is `IdeOnly` — but it is **S3-mirrored for
/// ide-down resilience**, matching the dashboard/app PNG charts that moved to S3
/// earlier (this route was the one left behind):
///
/// - When the ide serves a chart it mirrors the file to S3 (best-effort, no-op
///   without a bucket), so the object exists for cross-node reads.
/// - The route is `FleetOk` (`route_fleet` in `router/workspace.rs`), so a serve
///   replica runs this handler itself, misses on disk, and serves the S3 mirror
///   — a chart you've already viewed keeps loading while Oxygen Factory
///   restarts, instead of a hard 502.
///
/// Modern agentic-analytics charts are Postgres `DisplayBlock`s and never reach
/// this route; they already render on any replica.

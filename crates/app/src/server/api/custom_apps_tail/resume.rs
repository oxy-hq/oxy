//! A resumed tail (`Last-Event-ID`): what it replays.
//!
//! Lines are never stored for the tail, so a stream reopened after a dropped
//! connection cannot be given the lines it missed. What it is given is each
//! invocation's **outcome**, read back from `app_function_invocations`: one
//! `finish` (marked `replayed`) for every invocation of the environment that
//! finished after the last event the reader saw — at most [`LIMIT`], from at
//! most [`WINDOW`] ago.
//!
//! An event id is the stream's clock in milliseconds (`stream::EventIds`),
//! so "after the last event" is a time. The replica that held the old stream
//! and the one holding the new may disagree by their clock skew; an outcome
//! near the boundary can arrive twice, once live and once replayed, and the
//! `replayed` flag is what lets a reader drop the second.

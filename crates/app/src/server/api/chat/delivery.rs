//! Cross-replica message fan-out.
//!
//! # The problem this exists for
//!
//! Chat is served by the stateless fleet, so two people in the same channel are
//! routinely on different replicas. An in-process `broadcast` channel would
//! deliver a message to everyone on the replica that accepted the POST and to
//! nobody else. The bug is invisible on a single-instance dev box and total in
//! production.
//!
//! # Why not the world-model pattern
//!
//! The world-model bus faced the same problem and answered it differently:
//! `e9a9e9c8a` gave it a durable `world_model_events` table, with replay. That is
//! the right shape when a missed event cannot be reconstructed — a subscriber
//! that was offline has no other way to learn what happened.
//!
//! Chat's state is already durable in `chat_messages`, and the notification here
//! carries no information beyond "look again". A missed wake costs one client a
//! slightly later render, and the very next wake — or a navigation — repairs it
//! completely. Paying for a second durable log to protect a signal whose only
//! content is recoverable from the first would buy nothing.
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! Postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`, the same primitive `PostgresTaskRouter` already
//! uses to wake workers across this fleet. One dedicated listener connection per
//! process fans a notification out to the in-process subscribers for that
//! channel. No Redis, no new infrastructure, and it rides a Postgres every
//! replica already holds open.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not guaranteed
//!
//! `NOTIFY` is fire-and-forget: a payload dropped while a replica is
//! reconnecting is gone, and nothing replays it. So the notification carries
//! only a **channel id**, never message content — a client that misses one
//! re-reads the channel and is whole again. Treating the notification as the
//! message would make a dropped packet a permanently missing turn in somebody's
//! conversation.
//!
//! That is also why `subscribe` hands back a receiver rather than a stream of
//! rows: the SSE handler re-queries on every wake, so a coalesced burst costs
//! one query instead of being silently truncated.

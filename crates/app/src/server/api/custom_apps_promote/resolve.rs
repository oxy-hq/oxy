//! From a request to what it would move: the app, the environment that moves,
//! the build it moves to, and what it serves now (environments design §5.5a,
//! rulings 1, 2 and 6).
//!
//! - **Two promote paths, nothing else**: `dev-<handle>` → `staging` and
//!   `staging` → `production`. Any other pair is `400 promote_path_refused`
//!   — nothing promotes *to* a sandbox, and moving production backwards is a
//!   rollback.
//! - **A promote's build** is one the source has served — any
//!   `app_environment_events` row for that environment and build — named by
//!   its publish id or its UUID; without one, the source's current build.
//! - **A rollback's build** is one the environment served before; without
//!   one, the most recent such build that is not its current one (undo: twice
//!   swaps back). A pruned build's events carry no build, so it is never
//!   offered. A sandbox is not rolled back: it is published to again.

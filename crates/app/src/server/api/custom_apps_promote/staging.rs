//! Moving **staging's** pointer by promote or rollback: a sandbox's build
//! promoted to staging (`dev-<handle>` → `staging`), or staging rolled back
//! (environments design §5.5a, rulings 1, 4 and 6).
//!
//! A pointer move like a draft publish's — staging's row, in one transaction
//! holding the app's row — whose event
//! is `staging / promote` or `staging / rollback`. That `promote` event is
//! what later admits a sandbox's build to production: it is staging having
//! served it. Staging's migrations are then **queued** exactly as a publish
//! queues them (`custom_apps_nonproduction::staging_task`), and never fail
//! the move: a failure there is its run's, reported as a warning. Staging's
//! own schedule rows are reconciled to the build it now serves, as a publish
//! to staging reconciles them (`custom_apps_env_schedules`): none while its
//! switch is off.

//! Build-time brotli pre-compression for custom-app bundles.
//!
//! Compression moves from **once per request** to **once per publish**.
//! Before this, every asset response ran through the `CompressionLayer` on
//! `/customer-apps/{*path}` (`cli/commands/serve.rs`), so the same
//! immutable `main-a1b2c3.js` was re-compressed on every request, on every
//! replica, forever — pure CPU burn on the hot path, since a
//! content-hashed asset's bytes never change.
//!
//! At publish, [`precompressed_variants`] emits a sibling `<path>.br` object
//! for each worthwhile file. At serve, `custom_apps_serve::sources` probes
//! for that sibling when the client advertises `br` and streams it with
//! `Content-Encoding: br`, skipping the compressor entirely.
//!
//! ## Why this is safe to add to existing apps
//!
//! Builds published before this existed carry no `.br` objects. The probe
//! misses, the response falls through to the `CompressionLayer` exactly as
//! today, and the miss is remembered by `custom_apps_bundle_cache` so it
//! costs one store round-trip per object per process — not one per request.
//! No migration, no republish required.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT pre-compressed
//!
//! - **HTML.** The serve path rewrites the base path and splices
//!   `window.__OXY_APP__` into every HTML response
//!   (`custom_apps_serve::rewrite`), so the bytes on the wire are not the
//!   bytes in the store. A pre-compressed HTML object would be stale by
//!   construction.
//! - **Already-compressed media** (png/jpg/webp/gif/woff/woff2). Brotli over
//!   a PNG spends CPU to grow the file.
//! - **Tiny files.** Below [`MIN_PRECOMPRESS_BYTES`] the extra store object
//!   and its probe cost more than the bytes saved.

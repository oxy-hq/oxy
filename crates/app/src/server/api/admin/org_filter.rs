/// The org ids a **bounded** platform grant reaches — `None` for unbounded.

/// **Fallible on purpose.** An unreadable grant is not "unbounded"; it is *unknown*, and
/// the two callers of this need opposite things from that:
///
/// * a READ (`list_apps`, `oxy-access`) prefers to show rows — the capability gate
///   already admitted this caller, and a blip shouldn't present an empty console as
///   though it were the truth. [`scope_org_filter`] collapses `Err` that way.
/// * a WRITE (`create_app`, the `batch/*` endpoints) must refuse. Treating unknown as
///   unbounded there means one transient `DbErr` turns `batch/delete` into a
///   cross-tenant delete — which the module docs correctly call the worst leak this
///   model could have.
///
/// `app_scope_guard` already fails closed on `Err`. Having the two halves of one system
/// disagree about what an unreadable grant means is how this drifts, so the difference is
/// stated here once rather than re-decided at each call site.

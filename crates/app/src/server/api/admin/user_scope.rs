//! Scope for a row that belongs to a **person**: the user directory.
//!
//! [`super::scope`] fences a row by its org. A user has none — they are a member of zero
//! or more orgs — so whether a bounded grant reaches one is a question about those
//! memberships, and it has three answers:
//!
//! * **seeing** a user (the directory, the detail pane) needs *one* org of theirs in
//!   reach, and of that user shows only the rows those orgs own;
//! * **adding them to an org** needs what seeing them needs, so a grant cannot add
//!   someone to an org and so make them its own;
//! * **changing their status** needs *every* org of theirs in reach: `deleted` refuses
//!   the person on every protected route and at every login, in all of them at once.
//!
//! A user in no org is platform-level — an all-orgs grant and the Global Owner only —
//! the answer [`super::scope::deny_out_of_scope_opt`] gives any org-less row. Out of
//! reach is the same 404 a missing user gets.
//!
//! A status change has a second fence past scope ([`may_change_status`]): the Global
//! Owner cannot be locked out from the console, and a target who holds staff standing is
//! behind the delegation bound of their grant row. Suspending a peer Global Admin is
//! demoting them by other means, which is exactly what that bound refuses.

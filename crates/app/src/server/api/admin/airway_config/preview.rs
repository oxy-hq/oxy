//! `GET /api/admin/airway/config/{source_kind}/preview` — which resources an
//! admission policy would reject, *before* anyone saves it.
//!
//! Tasks 1-2 made `airway_source_config` editable. The hazard that creates is
//! one click wide: tightening a kind to `require_declared` halts every pipeline
//! whose resources don't satisfy it, and the refusal only surfaces at the next
//! run, as a config error from a queued worker. This endpoint answers what the
//! write endpoints cannot — *which* resources, in *which* pipelines, and
//! whether the operator can do anything about it.
//!
//! Two halves, deliberately separated:
//!
//! * [`verdicts`] is **pure**: resources + declared contracts + policy in,
//!   per-resource verdicts out. It mirrors airway's `ContractPolicy::check`,
//!   which collapses a whole connector to one `Err`, into the per-resource
//!   shape an operator can act on. `preview_tests.rs` pins it against the real
//!   `admit_with` so the two cannot drift on an airway bump.
//! * [`super::preview_scan`] enumerates pipelines from the **compile boundary**
//!   (`airway_pipelines`, scoped to each workspace's promoted revision),
//!   builds each connector, and feeds [`verdicts`].
//!
//! **Why compiled rows and not the working copy.** `agentic_pipeline::
//! airway_run` used to resolve a run's spec with `tokio::fs::read_to_string`,
//! which made it tempting to argue the working copy is "what actually runs"
//! and read that. That argument was rejected on the `oxy-compile-boundary`
//! rule — every per-request read comes from Postgres, and `airway_run`'s FS
//! read was itself the violation, not a precedent to inherit. It now reads the
//! compiled row too, so the argument has no premise left. `airway_pipelines`
//! already
//! carries `file_path` + `definition`, so nothing here needs a working copy,
//! and the route is `FleetOk` like the rest of this surface. **Do not "fix"
//! this back to an FS walk**; that would re-pin a Postgres-only admin surface
//! to the ide node.
//!
//! The accepted cost is that the preview reflects the **promoted revision** and
//! can lag an uncommitted/uncompiled working copy until the next compile. That
//! trade-off was taken deliberately: no staleness banner, no
//! uncompiled-changes detection.
//!
//! **Scope: this route carries its own fence, like every other per-workspace
//! route on the surface.** `platform_cap_guard` decides on
//! `Resource::platform()`, which has no org, so a *bounded* `global_admin`
//! passes the `PlatformOperate` gate and narrowing is the handler's job. This
//! one shipped without it while the neighbouring routes were being fenced, and
//! the gap was the largest of the set: the response is per-tenant detail —
//! [`ResourceVerdict::pipeline_ref`] is `{workspace_id}:{real file path}`,
//! [`ResourceVerdict::resource`] names tables inside another tenant's pipeline,
//! and [`UnevaluatedPipeline::error`] is `serde`/`validate()` text quoting their
//! `.airway.yml`. A two-org operator could enumerate every tenant's airway
//! pipelines through it, which is strictly more than `get_config` ever
//! returned. So [`preview_policy`] resolves the caller's reach with the same
//! `scope_org_filter` `get_config` uses and hands it to
//! [`super::preview_scan::scan_pipelines`].
//!
//! **The withheld portion is reported as a count, never dropped.** A bounded
//! operator can still write the fleet-wide *global* row (the residual recorded
//! at `admin::mod`'s mount point), so a preview that quietly omitted the other
//! tenants would render a short, clean list for a change that reaches all of
//! them — "reads as safe, means unknown", the failure this whole surface's save
//! gate exists to prevent. [`PolicyPreviewResponse::out_of_scope_pipelines`] is
//! a bare number for the same reason the detail is fenced: it says *that* the
//! view is partial without saying *whose*.
//!
//! **Both admission axes are previewed**, `contract_policy` and `environment`.
//! An earlier version scoped this to `contract_policy` alone, reasoning that
//! `environment` is a per-connector yes/no with no per-resource verdict, so
//! previewing it would render a table of identical rows. That is an argument
//! about the *table*, not about which environment the scan is *computed*
//! under, and taking it that far was a bug: the frontend's save gate trusts
//! this body, and a body computed under `Environment::Production` says nothing
//! about a save that sets `sandbox`. `environment` is now a query parameter
//! threaded to `build_source_connector` and echoed back in the response, so a
//! preview is attributable to the exact `(source_kind, contract_policy,
//! environment)` triple it was computed under and the client can verify that
//! rather than assume it.

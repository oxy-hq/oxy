//! `/api/admin/airway/deployment-config` — staff read/write of airway's
//! **operational tier** (`airway_deployment_config`), under the same
//! `cap(Action::PlatformOperate)` as the rest of `/admin/airway` (see
//! [`super`]). Not owner-only: a Global Admin holds that capability too.
//!
//! The sibling routes in [`super::handlers`] edit the *policy* tier: per
//! source kind, per workspace, resolved on every run. This one edits the eight
//! settings airway installs into a process-wide `OnceLock` — `timeout`,
//! `max_retries`, `user_agent`, `retry_initial_delay`, `retry_max_delay`,
//! `retry_backoff_factor`, `cursor_lag_floor`, `tls`.
//!
//! # A save here is not live, and the response says so
//!
//! `airway::config::global::install` is one-shot: the second call is refused
//! and its values are dropped. So editing this row changes what the *next*
//! process to boot installs, and nothing about the ones already running. That
//! is why the read route reports the installed state beside the configured one
//! instead of only echoing the row back — without it an operator saves a
//! value, sees it stored, and believes it is in force.
//!
//! # `installed` is one process's state, and is labelled as such
//!
//! [`agentic_airway::installed_values`] reads *this* process's `OnceLock`.
//! Every oxy-app entry point that can build an airway connector installs at
//! boot (`crate::airway_boot`), so on a healthy fleet the replica answering
//! this request has installed — but it installed *its own* boot-time read of
//! the row, which on a rolling deploy is not necessarily the row as it stands
//! now, and on a replica that failed to resolve it is nothing at all. Neither
//! a replica's values nor its `None` is evidence about the deployment; they
//! are evidence about one process.
//!
//! Rather than presenting that as the deployment's state, the response carries
//! [`InstalledScope`]: which process answered (role, pid, hostname), whether a
//! node in that role drains the durable queue in-process at all, and whether
//! it installed. When it did not, [`DriftReport::status`] is `unknown` with a
//! reason — never `in_sync`, which is the reading that would actually mislead.
//! The frontend renders that as "this process installed no tier", not as a
//! green tick, and — since the install is at boot — points the operator at that
//! process's log rather than telling them a run has simply not happened yet.
//!
//! # `FleetOk`
//!
//! Postgres plus one process-local `OnceLock` read: no workspace FS, no
//! `.git`, no state dir. Classified in `role_manifest.rs` alongside the rest of
//! the airway-config surface.

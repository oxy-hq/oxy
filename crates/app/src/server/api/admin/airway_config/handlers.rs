//! Handlers for `/api/admin/airway/config` — read (Task 1) and write
//! (Task 2).
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This surface is gated by `cap(Action::PlatformOperate)`, and that gate
//! decides on `Resource::platform()` — a resource with no org — so it cannot
//! consult the caller's **scope**. Capabilities gate verbs; scope filters rows
//! (see `admin::scope` and `platform_cap_guard`). Every per-workspace route
//! here therefore carries the row-level half itself:
//!
//! * the two override writes fence with [`deny_out_of_scope_for_workspace`]
//!   *before* touching the table;
//! * [`get_config`] filters the overrides it returns to the caller's reach.
//!
//! The third route that returns per-tenant rows is the policy preview, and it
//! lives next door: `super::preview::preview_policy` takes the same
//! [`scope_org_filter`] and hands it to the scan. This list named only the
//! routes in *this file* for one release, which read as a complete inventory of
//! the surface's fences and was not one — the preview was returning every
//! tenant's workspace ids and `.airway.yml` paths the whole time. It is
//! enumerated here because the sentence above claims "every per-workspace
//! route", and that claim has to be checkable against the router.
//!
//! **Known and accepted: the global row stays fleet-wide.** A scoped operator
//! who reaches one org can still edit the `workspace_id IS NULL` row that
//! governs every tenant's pipelines — see `admin::mod`'s note at the mount
//! point for why that was taken rather than overlooked, and what would have to
//! change to close it.

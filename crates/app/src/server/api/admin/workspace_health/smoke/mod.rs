//! Workspace smoke test: active end-to-end probes of a workspace's own
//! artifacts, rolled up as the `smoke_test` health dimension.
//!
//! Where the passive dimensions count rows in Postgres, this one *exercises* the
//! workspace: pings every warehouse connection, runs a measure query through the
//! semantic model, runs each data app, and asks an agent a fixed question. It is
//! the same shape as `reconcile` — a runner trait producing verdicts that the
//! evaluator folds into a dimension — but it runs on its own slower cadence
//! (default 6h) because every probe costs a warehouse round-trip and the agent
//! probe costs tokens. See `config.rs` for the cadence gate.
//!
//! Verdict semantics, mirroring `reconcile::unreachable_verdict`:
//! * probe ran and passed → Healthy
//! * probe ran and failed → **Unhealthy** (the artifact is genuinely broken)
//! * probe timed out, or could not be attempted → **Degraded** (unknown, not
//!   wrong — an unknown must never page as a hard failure)
//! * targets skipped by the `max_targets` cap → Healthy, with a reason. Caps are
//!   recorded, never silent, but a large workspace is not a degraded one.

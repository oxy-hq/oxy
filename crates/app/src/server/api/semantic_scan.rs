//! Moved to `oxy::config::scan`.
//!
//! These materialisers ARE the compiled-vs-disk decision for the artifacts a
//! Path-based consumer needs (airlayer's scan dir, an agent's `context:` root,
//! `.monitor.yml`). That decision belongs to `ConfigManager` — living here made
//! it a free function every caller could reach around, and the four
//! `compiled_*` row readers it uses had to be public for it, which is what let
//! three other call sites write their own half of the choice.
//!
//! They are `pub(super)` in core now. This module re-exports the entry points
//! so the call sites read the same; there is no second door left.

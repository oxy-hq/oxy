//! Storage for versioned custom-app bundles.
//!
//! Each publish writes its files under
//! `customer-apps/<app_id>/builds/<build_id>/`. Two backends, selected at
//! call time by whether `OXY_CUSTOMER_APPS_S3_BUCKET` is set:
//!
//! - **S3** (cloud / configured): the single source of truth — oxy holds no
//!   local copy. The serve path reads objects back through an in-memory
//!   cache ([`super::custom_apps_bundle_cache`]).
//! - **Filesystem** (local dev, no bucket): files land under
//!   `<OXY_STATE_DIR>/customer-apps/<app_id>/builds/<build_id>/` so an
//!   engineer can `oxy serve` + `oxy publish` locally without MinIO/S3.
//!
//! Either way the logical key is [`build_prefix`]; it's recorded verbatim in
//! `app_builds.s3_prefix` and interpreted as an S3 key or an FS subpath
//! depending on the active backend. The serve path goes through this module,
//! so local serve "just works" off the filesystem.

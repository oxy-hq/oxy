//! In-memory LRU over custom-app bundle objects.
//!
//! The serve path resolves `(app_id, build_id, rel_path)` to bytes; this
//! cache absorbs hot reads so S3 is hit only on a miss. Keyed by
//! `"<app_id>/<build_id>/<rel_path>"` — because `build_id` is part of the
//! key, a promote/rollback (which repoints to a different build) serves
//! fresh bytes with no explicit invalidation.
//!
//! ## Absences are cached too
//!
//! A *known-absent* object is remembered rather than re-fetched, in a
//! second LRU held apart from the bytes (see [`byte_cache`] for why the two
//! must not share a map). A build's file set is fixed once
//! `put_build` returns — the prefix is written once and never appended to —
//! so "not in this build" is a permanent fact for that `build_id`, and
//! caching it is safe.
//!
//! That invariant is **enforced, not assumed**. `put_build` never wipes a
//! prefix before writing, so a second publish under a reused `build_id` would
//! merge into the first — and a file the rebuild added would read as
//! permanently absent here, which for a `.js` request means the SPA
//! `index.html` fallback at 200 rather than the asset. Two things keep that
//! from happening: `custom_apps_publish` rejects a publish whose
//! `(app_id, build_id)` already has an `app_builds` row (409), and the CLI's
//! default id is unique per CI *run*, not per commit, so a workflow re-run
//! doesn't collide in the first place (`cli/commands/publish.rs::ci_build_id`).
//! If either is ever relaxed, this section is the thing that breaks.
//!
//! Two hot paths depend on this, and both re-fetched on *every* request
//! before it existed:
//!   - **SPA fallback.** A client-side route (`/orders/42`) misses the
//!     object store, then falls back to `index.html`. Without negative
//!     caching that's one doomed store round-trip per navigation, forever.
//!   - **Pre-compressed variants.** The serve path probes `<path>.br`
//!     (see `custom_apps_precompress`). Builds published before
//!     pre-compression existed have no `.br` objects at all, so every
//!     asset request on an old build would pay a doomed probe.
//!
//! Errors are **not** cached — only a definitive present/absent answer is,
//! so a transient S3 failure retries on the next request.

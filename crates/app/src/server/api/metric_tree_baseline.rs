//! Rescuing the scenario queries one batched request cannot answer.
//!
//! Airlayer refuses a query that puts an additive measure (`sum`/`count`/
//! `min`/`max`) in the same view's CTE as a non-additive one (`custom`/`avg`/
//! `count_distinct`/…) when a dimension, filter or segment drags a one-to-many
//! join into that CTE — the additive side would be double-counted by the
//! fan-out and nothing would say so. The refusal is correct. What it takes
//! down with it is not: a scenario batches measures for its own reasons, and
//! the mixture is an artefact of the metric tree's shape, not something the
//! analyst asked for.
//!
//! Two separate call sites batch this way, and BOTH hit it:
//!
//!   * the baseline (`reachable_values_outcome`) asks for every node forward-
//!     reachable from the levers in one query;
//!   * the fit (`fit_driver_coefficients`) asks for both endpoints of every
//!     fittable driver edge in one panel query.
//!
//! Which one breaks depends only on which lever is pinned, so fixing them
//! one at a time just moves the symptom. This module fixes the shape instead:
//! it decorates the `QueryExecutor` itself, so any batched request that a
//! mixture refuses gets retried as unmixed halves and merged back, and neither
//! caller needs to know.
//!
//! The split is by **(view, additivity)** — one request per pair. Additivity
//! is what clears the guard; the view is what stops the split from causing a
//! worse problem than it solves. An additivity-only split co-locates measures
//! from views at different grains, and asking for a store-grain sum under
//! check-grain dimensions joins the coarse view in on a partial key, fanning
//! out BOTH measures. `checks.total_guests` came back 3,100x inflated and
//! constant across every day of a panel, which the fit reports as "the driver
//! does not vary within any panel" — a silent wrong number where there had
//! been a loud refusal. Grouping by view too means a request only ever carries
//! measures that already shared a CTE, so the split can never invent a join
//! the original query did not have.
//!
//! Deliberately a RETRY, not the default path. A single-view tree batches
//! fine, and must not pay a second round trip for a problem it doesn't have.

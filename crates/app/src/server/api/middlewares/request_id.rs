//! `x-oxy-request-id` — one server-minted id per HTTP request.
//!
//! ## Why the server mints it rather than trusting the caller
//!
//! This id is the join key that makes *"a user says the app broke at 3:04pm"* a
//! query instead of an archaeology project: the same value lands on the serve
//! row, the function invocation, every `ctx.log()` line that invocation writes,
//! and (once the client-error table exists) the browser beacon. A caller-supplied
//! id would let one request claim another's identity, so an inbound
//! `x-oxy-request-id` is **ignored and overwritten** — except on an internal
//! proxy hop, which is re-entering this middleware on the ide pod with an id
//! the client already has. That exception is gated on the receiving process's
//! own role, never on an inbound header, because a header is settable by
//! anyone who can reach the edge. That matches how the
//! platforms this borrows from behave — `cf-ray` and `x-vercel-id` are minted by
//! the edge, never accepted from the client. The browser learns the id from the
//! *response* header.
//!
//! ## Three places it shows up
//!
//! 1. **Request extensions** as [`RequestId`], for handlers that can take an
//!    extractor.
//! 2. **Request headers**, so the many handlers that already take a bare
//!    `HeaderMap` can read it without a signature change. Note this is *not* how
//!    it reaches an Oxy Function: `custom_apps_functions::sanitize_request_headers`
//!    strips every `x-oxy-*` header before the isolate sees the request, which is
//!    a rule worth keeping — the id is passed to the runtime explicitly instead.
//! 3. **Response headers**, which is the only way a browser (or a support ticket)
//!    can name the request that went wrong.
//!
//! Mounted on the OUTER router in `cli/commands/serve.rs` so it covers `/api`,
//! the `/customer-apps/{*path}` serve tree and the static SPA fallback alike.

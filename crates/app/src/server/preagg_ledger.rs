//! What THIS node's builder actually did to each rollup hash.
//!
//! The manifest cannot answer that. It is a fleet-wide artifact — every
//! rebuild rewrites the whole file, `mirror_manifest_to_s3` uploads it, and
//! `sync_manifest_from_s3` pulls a newer one down on every status read — so an
//! entry in it means "somebody built this", never "this node built this, with
//! this builder". Two decisions need the stronger fact:
//!
//! * A builder-generation sweep asks "is the artifact behind this hash the
//!   PREVIOUS builder's?". Answered from the manifest alone it is an inference
//!   from fleet state, and a node whose stamp is behind would sweep — and on a
//!   transient failure retract — entries another node had already rebuilt
//!   correctly, mirroring the deletion fleet-wide. The `generation` field makes
//!   the claim checkable: a hash this node committed at the current generation
//!   is not swept at all.
//! * A zero-row rebuild RETRACTS its entry (see `preagg_retract`), which erases
//!   the manifest's `build_date` and `refresh_key_value` — the two fields both
//!   staleness evaluators read. Without a record of the attempt, a legitimately
//!   empty rollup reads as never-built and rebuilds on every cadence tick
//!   forever. `empty` is that record: the rebuild ran, its honest answer was
//!   "no rows", and the refresh key still gets to suppress the next tick.
//!
//! Lives beside `builder_generation` in the workspace's airlayer cache dir and
//! is deliberately NOT part of `manifest.json`: the manifest's shape is
//! airlayer's, and anything stored in it would be mirrored and re-synced —
//! which is exactly the property that disqualifies it from answering either
//! question.
//!
//! Every mutator is load-modify-save on one small file, so callers must hold
//! the per-workspace publish lock — the same lock `commit_manifest_and_cache`
//! and `retract_manifest_and_cache` require, and for the same reason: the
//! ledger entry and the manifest entry are one publish.

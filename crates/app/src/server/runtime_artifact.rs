//! Multi-instance read-through for runtime-generated FS artifacts.
//!
//! Some artifacts are written to a node's LOCAL filesystem during a
//! request/run flow and read back by a LATER HTTP request — query-result
//! parquet files, Data App chart PNGs. On a stateless serve fleet the read
//! round-robins across replicas, so the node that fetches the artifact is
//! usually NOT the one that wrote it → 404 / blank render.
//!
//! Rather than rewrite every producer to be S3-native, this module adds a
//! cheap, additive safety net:
//!
//!   - On WRITE: after the local file is written, best-effort mirror the
//!     bytes to S3 ([`mirror`]). Failures are logged, never fatal.
//!   - On READ: serve the local file when present; on a local miss, fall
//!     back to S3 ([`fetch`]). The local path stays the fast path; S3 is
//!     only consulted for the cross-node case.
//!
//! Storage reuses the **compile-boundary blob bucket**
//! (`OXY_COMPILE_BLOB_S3_BUCKET`, already provisioned and readable by every
//! fleet pod) via [`oxy_compile::blob_store`] — no new bucket, no new env
//! var. When the bucket is unset (local dev / single node) every S3 op is a
//! no-op and behavior is byte-identical to before: the local file is the
//! only copy and is always served from the node that wrote it.
//!
//! Keys are workspace-scoped so the shared bucket stays multi-tenant-safe.

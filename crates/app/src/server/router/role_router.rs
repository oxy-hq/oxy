//! A router where a route's pod is a type, not a note.
//!
//! `role_manifest.rs` held the same fact in a second place — a hand-written path
//! table, matched by string. Being second, it could disagree with the routes, and
//! a route nobody added to it defaulted to `FleetOk`: a handler that reads the
//! working copy shipped fleet-served and 404ed on every replica. That is how
//! `GET /apps/source/{file}` shipped broken.
//!
//! Every route goes through [`RoleRouter::route_ide`] or
//! [`RoleRouter::route_fleet`], and the two take differently-typed handlers.
//! `WorkspaceManagerWorkingCopy` resolves only from `IdeState`, so a handler that
//! asks for a working copy produces a `MethodRouter<IdeState>` and **will not
//! compile** through the fleet door. The role stops being a claim about the
//! handler and becomes something the compiler has checked.
//!
//! Mounting is `route_service`, so each route carries its own state and the
//! tree above it stays one `Router<AppState>` — no splitting the router in two.
//! `route_service` does not merge, so a path's verbs go in one call; a path
//! whose verbs sit on opposite sides uses [`RoleRouter::route_split`].
//!
//! The declarations accumulated here are what `role_manifest::classify` reads,
//! so the routing table is a by-product of building the server rather than a
//! description of it.

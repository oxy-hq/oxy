//! What a custom-app build records about where its code came from.
//!
//! `app_builds.source_repo` + `commit_sha` is the only path from a running
//! custom app back to its code — the build store holds build output, and
//! there is no source export (see `internal-docs/customer-apps.md` §12). Two
//! places ask whether that path exists, for different audiences:
//!
//! - `oxy publish` warns the engineer at publish time, when it's still cheap
//!   to fix;
//! - the admin apps list flags builds already in the field, which is where
//!   you find the ones published before anybody was warning.
//!
//! They used to answer it separately and disagreed: the CLI stayed quiet
//! unless BOTH halves were missing while the server flagged EITHER, so a
//! `--dir` publish from CI (commit from `$GITHUB_SHA`, no `origin` to read)
//! published silently and then sat amber in the admin list forever — the
//! exact surprise the publish-time warning exists to prevent. Hence one
//! module, deliberately owned by neither `cli` nor `server`.
//!
//! The rule: **both halves are required**. A repo with no commit points at a
//! moving branch, and a commit with no repo points nowhere; neither gets you
//! to the code that is actually running. Blank and whitespace-only count as
//! missing — `--repo ""` is not provenance.

//! Streaming-safe filter that replaces Oxy's `:::artifact{...}:::` directives
//! with a short inline placeholder ("📎 *title*") before we push the text
//! to Slack. Slack messages get a single "View thread in Oxygen →" footer
//! button, so per-artifact deep links would be redundant noise — and we
//! don't have direct linking to individual tool-call results anyway.
//!
//! The agent emits artifact blocks inline as colon-fenced directives whose
//! length varies (3 or more colons — see `crates/core/src/types.rs`). The
//! Oxy web app renders them with a rich artifact component; Slack has no
//! equivalent, so we swap the raw directive for a compact attribution line
//! pointing back at the full thread in Oxy. Persistence of the structured
//! artifact row itself is handled independently via BlockHandler — this
//! filter only shapes the Slack message body.
//!
//! When no thread URL is configured (Slack misconfigured), the filter falls
//! back to its older drop-silently behaviour so the stream never leaks raw
//! fence markers into the user's view.
//!
//! The filter is stateful because fences can straddle stream chunk
//! boundaries: an opening `:::artifact{…}` can arrive in one flush batch
//! and its matching closer `:::` in the next. `feed` emits only the prefix
//! that's definitely outside any open fence; a half-open fence is buffered
//! and re-joined with the next chunk.

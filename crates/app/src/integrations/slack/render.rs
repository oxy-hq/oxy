//! `SlackRenderer` — [`oxy::ClientRenderer`] impl for Slack.
//!
//! Prose is buffered, not streamed: live token reveal looks frozen during
//! tool calls (the bubble shows "Let me check…" while SQL runs for 10s).
//! The `loading_messages` rotation via `setStatus` carries the "alive"
//! signal; `chat.postMessage` reveals the full prose at the end.
//!
//! Charts: render PNG bytes during streaming and queue them. The actual
//! upload happens *after* `chat.postMessage` posts the prose, so the text
//! answer always reaches the thread first and the auto-shared chart files
//! land as thread replies underneath. Embedding charts as `slack_file`
//! blocks inside the prose message looked tidier but turned out to be
//! brittle — Slack rejects the message when the file isn't yet visible
//! to the channel — so we use the same "post text, then auto-share" shape
//! Datadog and Grafana use. See `events::execution::run_for_slack` for
//! the orchestration. When `OXY_SLACK_CHART_UPLOAD` is unset (the dev
//! default), uploads are skipped and PNGs surface as on-disk paths in a
//! footer context block — Slack can't fetch localhost so there's no
//! inline preview, but devs can `open` the file.
//!
//! Reasoning events are dropped — Slack has no collapsible-reasoning UI.

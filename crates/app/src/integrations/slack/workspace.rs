//! Building the workspace manager a Slack message runs against.
//!
//! One function, because resolution and execution were each constructing their
//! own. `/slack/events` is `FleetOk`, so both run on stateless replicas with no
//! working copy: a manager built from `config.yml` there carries an empty
//! `Config` — no `databases:`, no `models:` — and the run answers from nothing.
//! Reading the compile boundary first is what makes the reply correct, and doing
//! it in one place is what makes the agent that was *chosen* and the run that
//! *executes* it agree on a revision.
//!
//! A Slack message carries no branch context, so the hint is always `None`: the
//! promoted default-branch revision.

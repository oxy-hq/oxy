//! Local-mode seeding for the per-org OLTP POC.
//!
//! Mirrors `airhouse::local_seed`, which seeds the rows the provision flow needs
//! so local mode works untouched. This one goes a step further and produces a
//! **real, queryable Postgres**: the demo runs the same DDL generators as
//! production ([`crate::platform`], [`crate::schema`]), so what you query in the
//! IDE is the actual role model, not a mock-up of it.
//!
//! Deliberately does **not** touch Oxy's control plane. `OltpProvisioner` needs
//! `organizations` rows and a migrated database; this needs only a running
//! Postgres, which keeps `cargo run --example seed_local` a one-liner.
//!
//! Idempotent: safe to re-run. Pass `reset: true` to drop and rebuild.

//! Role creation in **SQL**, deliberately not through the provider API.
//!
//! # Why not the provider's `create_role`
//!
//! Every role Neon creates through its REST API is made a member of
//! `neon_superuser` and given `CREATEDB`, `CREATEROLE` and `BYPASSRLS`. That is
//! reasonable for a project's own owner and catastrophic for anything else: it
//! makes the "read-only analyst" able to read every schema — including `app_*`
//! that never opted into analytics, and `oxy_meta` — and lets one app's writer
//! read every other app's data. The entire isolation model of this crate is
//! those two boundaries.
//!
//! It cannot be undone after the fact. The database owner is not a member with
//! ADMIN option, so `REVOKE neon_superuser FROM …` fails:
//!
//! ```text
//! ERROR: permission denied to revoke role "neon_superuser"
//! DETAIL: Only roles with the ADMIN option on role "neon_superuser" may revoke this role.
//! ```
//!
//! A role created by `CREATE ROLE` as the owner has none of it — verified
//! against live Neon: no memberships, and `createdb/createrole/bypassrls/
//! replication` all false. So Oxy mints its own roles and leaves the provider
//! API responsible for the project alone.
//!
//! What the API grants instead is not folklore. Neon's own open-source
//! `compute_ctl` spells it out in `compute_tools/src/spec_apply.rs`:
//!
//! ```text
//! CREATE ROLE x INHERIT CREATEROLE CREATEDB BYPASSRLS REPLICATION IN ROLE neon_superuser
//! ```
//!
//! [`assert_confined_sql`] checks all of those, plus `rolsuper` — Oxy's own
//! addition, since a provider that ever handed back a true superuser would
//! otherwise pass. Four attributes from Neon, five in
//! [`CONFINEMENT_ATTRIBUTES`], and a membership.
//!
//! Which is also the simpler story: `LocalProvider` already created roles in
//! SQL, so this is one path instead of two, and it works on any Postgres.
//!
//! # Least privilege, by asking for nothing
//!
//! This section used to say every attribute is spelled out rather than left to
//! the server default. The code has argued the opposite for a while and the
//! header did not follow: `SUPERUSER`, `CREATEDB`, `CREATEROLE`, `REPLICATION`
//! and `BYPASSRLS` can each only be changed by a role that already holds it —
//! *even to switch it off* — so naming them turns a correct role into a failed
//! provision, and which ones fail depends on the owner. They are all off by
//! default, so [`ensure_login_role_sql`] asks for nothing and
//! [`assert_confined_sql`] verifies.
//!
//! `NOINHERIT` is the one exception and is set explicitly: not a privilege
//! attribute, so a `CREATEROLE` owner may set it, and a role that inherits
//! nothing cannot pick up privileges from a group it is later added to.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! [`assert_confined_sql`] re-reads the role after creating it and raises if it
//! came out with any authority it should not have. If a provider changes what
//! `CREATE ROLE` produces, provisioning must break loudly rather than quietly
//! hand out a superuser — this crate's whole reason for existing is a boundary,
//! and a boundary that fails open is worse than none.

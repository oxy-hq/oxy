//! `information_schema` shows a SELECT-only role, whether DDL and its ledger
//! row commit together. A mock provider would have passed all of them.
//!
//! Needs its OWN throwaway Postgres — NOT `oxy start`'s.
//!
//! ```bash
//! just oltp-test-db   # a disposable postgres:18 on :15433
//! cargo nextest run -p oxy-oltp --test integration
//! ```
//!
//! **On :15433, deliberately off `oxy start`'s :15432.** This suite creates
//! and drops whole databases and mints cluster-global roles, and
//! `refuse_if_cluster_is_in_use` makes it refuse any cluster already holding
//! `oxy_org_*` tenants. `oxy start` now provisions per-org OLTP into its own
//! :15432 cluster by default, so sharing that port meant one Provision click
//! blocked this suite for good — and the printed escape hatch is the
//! unqualified `just oltp-down`. A separate port keeps the two from ever
//! colliding.
//!
//! Skips (rather than fails) when the cluster is absent, so `just test` on a
//! machine without Docker stays green — unless `OXY_OLTP_REQUIRE_DB=1` (which
//! CI sets), where absence is a red build.
//!
//! **That skip is load-bearing and once hid this suite from CI entirely.** The
//! DSN defaults to :15433 now, and CI runs a throwaway `oltp-postgres` service
//! on exactly that port and credentials (`ci.yaml`). Anything that changes the
//! default DSN has to change that service with it, or the suite goes quiet
//! again in the way that looks green.

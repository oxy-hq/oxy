//! Live tests against the **real Neon API**.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate tests the client against a stub of Neon's
//! published response shapes. A stub proves the client agrees with the spec; it
//! cannot prove the spec matches the service. These do.
//!
//! **Opt-in, and not just by credential presence.** Running these creates and
//! destroys real projects in a real Neon org. `NEON_API_KEY` may legitimately be
//! set in a dev `.env` for `oxy oltp provision`, so keying off it alone would
//! make an ordinary `cargo nextest run` start spending money:
//!
//! ```bash
//! OXY_NEON_LIVE_TEST=1 cargo nextest run -p oxy-oltp --test integration \
//!   -E 'test(neon_live)' --no-capture
//! ```
//!
//! Each test cleans up the project it made **even when an assertion fails** —
//! the assertions run after teardown, on captured values, because a panic would
//! otherwise leak a billable project every red run.

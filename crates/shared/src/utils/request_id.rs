//! `x-oxy-request-id` — the wire name and the reader.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in `oxy-shared` and not beside the middleware
//!
//! The middleware that *mints* the id is `oxy-app`'s
//! `server::api::middlewares::request_id`. But the custom-apps surface needs to
//! *read* it, and `crates/app/tests/custom_apps/custom_apps_boundary.rs` bans a
//! `crate::` back-edge from that surface into `server::api::middlewares` — a
//! seam deleted on purpose in 2026-07 with an explicit "do not re-add".
//!
//! The sanctioned answer, and the precedent that test records for
//! `custom_app_url`, is to move the shared piece *down* into a crate both sides
//! already depend on. So the name and the parse live here; the minting policy
//! stays in the middleware, where it belongs.
